    "comments": "While the application is well-developed and highly applicable in clinical settings, some refinements can elevate its impact further. Firstly, incorporating explainability tools (like SHAP or LIME) into the prediction output would provide clinicians with interpretable reasons for each risk classification, addressing AI transparency concerns more directly. Secondly, although three models were used, expanding the scope to include ensemble methods or deep learning classifiers could improve prediction accuracy and robustness\u2014especially important in medical use cases.\n\nFrom a UX and deployment standpoint, future iterations could include mobile optimization and multi-language support, broadening accessibility in diverse healthcare environments. The entrepreneur segment is strong; however, demonstrating preliminary traction, pilot partnerships, or even mock-up pricing tiers would give greater business credibility. Lastly, the pitch could briefly mention data privacy safeguards (e.g., HIPAA/GDPR compliance), which are critical for gaining trust in real-world healthcare deployment.\n\nOverall, the project combines strong technical foundations with thoughtful usability, and with a few added layers of clinical relevance and commercial polish, it has excellent startup potential.",

By introducing real-world use cases\u2014such as how a journalist or student might use the system daily\u2014viewers could more easily grasp the relevance and impact of the tool. \n\nOn the entrepreneurial front, the proposed monetization strategies are promising, especially the B2B API offering. However, to strengthen the business case, a clearer view of the competitive landscape and market differentiation would be useful. Additionally, showcasing potential partners (like news agencies or academic publishers) or outlining initial user feedback could make the pitch more convincing. With improvements to delivery style\u2014such as speaking with more vocal variation and confidence\u2014the overall presentation could rise to a professional level suitable for investors or incubator pitches.",

    "comments": "Understanding:\nThis project aims to develop an AI-driven personal finance management system that analyzes monthly spending patterns, classifies expenses, predicts budgets, and identifies receipts eligible for personal tax relief. It combines several AI tools, including OCR for receipt extraction, linear regression for budget prediction, and Gemini AI for tax relief classification. The system also includes infographic-based financial tips to promote better money management.\n\nVerdict:\nWhile the overall idea is not novel\u2014similar systems already exist in the market\u2014it is still a relevant and practical application. Apps like Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), PocketGuard, Expensify, and Wally already support receipt scanning, expense tracking, and budget categorization.  What makes this project notable at the undergraduate level is the  integration of various components into a single platform. Bringing together OCR, classification, prediction, and user-friendly output shows a good grasp of how to apply AI tools meaningfully.\n\nThe project does not break new ground, but for a bachelor's level, it's a good effort that demonstrates applied learning and practical system design. With more refinement, especially around the tax relief identification tailored to local policies, the tool could serve a useful niche.",

    "comments": "Integrating real-time threat intelligence, notably using MISP as a threat database is a commendable approach. However, several architectural and operational limitations must be addressed for this system to be production-ready.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Threat Intelligence Integration: Using MISP adds valuable context to SIEM alerts and supports faster incident response.\n\n2. Centralized Data Pipeline: Logstash helps normalize and route logs from multiple agents to Elasticsearch.\n\n\n3. Rule-based Detection: Simple alert rules provide a baseline for identifying suspicious activity.\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n1. Scalability Issue: Logstash alone is not scalable for high-throughput environments. It lacks message persistence and backpressure handling.\n\n\n2. Overcollection of Logs: The system collects all logs indiscriminately, causing noise and performance overhead.\n\n\n3. Basic Alerting Rules: Current rules in Elasticsearch are limited to simple high/low thresholds, which are not adaptive or behavior-aware.\n\n\n4. Lack of Clarity on Log Source: It\u2019s unclear whether logs are from Windows Event Viewer, Syslog, or other sources, which affects rule design accuracy.\n\n\n5. Limited Business Context: While MISP is technical, the project lacks mapping to specific business use cases or risk models.\n\n\nSuggestions:\n\nUse Kafka as a buffer between Logstash and Elasticsearch to ensure durability, enable horizontal scaling, and decouple log ingestion from processing.\n\nImplement Detection Algorithms: Incorporate anomaly detection using ML models or unsupervised clustering on log behavior instead of relying purely on static rules.\n\nRefine Alert Rules: Use field-based conditions (e.g., repeated failed logins from same IP, process injection attempts) and correlate events over time.\n\nLog Scope Optimization: Define specific log types and fields that are meaningful for threat detection to reduce noise.\n\nBusiness Alignment: Map MISP indicators to actual assets and business impact (e.g., malware targeting financial systems).\n\n\nBy focusing on log quality, rule precision, and system scalability, this SIEM enhancement project can move from a promising concept to a viable enterprise solution.\n\n",

    "comments": "The IoT-Enabled Home Security System (IOTHSS) built using ESP32 and PIR motion sensors is a solid and promising  project. It demonstrates a low-cost, functional prototype that integrates basic motion detection with real-time notification via Telegram and uses Firebase as a backend.\n\nOne of the main strengths is its affordability and accessibility. The ESP32 is an excellent microcontroller for prototyping thanks to its built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and GPIO support. The use of Firebase simplifies real-time data updates, making it ideal for initial implementations.\n\nHowever, there are key areas for improvement. The dashboard is overly simple\u2014it only shows system status (ON/OFF) without any motion history or visual analytics. Enhancing it to display event logs, time stamps, and graphical trends would significantly increase usability.\n\nRole-based access (Admin/User) is also missing, which limits control in multi-user environments. Hardware configuration features such as setting detection zones or adjusting sensitivity are not exposed to the user. These settings should be available in future versions to allow for greater flexibility.\n\nTelegram integration is effective, but data privacy must be carefully considered. Platforms like Telegram aren\u2019t ideal for sensitive data transmission. Using your own app or backend to manage alerts, with scope-limited data sharing, would be more secure and privacy-compliant\u2014especially when considering GDPR or PDPA requirements.\n\nTo improve scalability, migrating to a message bus architecture (e.g., MQTT or Kafka) is recommended due to the event-driven nature of sensor data. This approach would better support future expansion with multiple sensors or smart devices.\n\nLastly, the system would benefit from an architectural diagram outlining data flow and hardware interactions. This would provide clearer insights for future upgrades.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a great foundation that can evolve into a robust system with thoughtful architectural and security enhancements.",

    "comments": "1. It would be beneficial to provide more detailed information on the listing page. Currently, important details such as quantity, weight, and specific location are missing. The use of a broad location like \"Penang, Malaysia\" may not be helpful for buyers, especially since Penang covers a wide area.\n\n2. Each listing should ideally include a minimum bid amount to offer guidance for potential bidders. Without this, users may be uncertain about how to place a reasonable starting bid, which could hinder engagement.\n\n3. The shipping options presented in the demo - particularly using DHL for waste materials, appear to be impractical due to high costs. It would be advisable to explore more cost-effective and realistic logistics solutions, tailored to the nature of the goods being listed.\n\n4. The dashboard interface could be improved to enhance usability. Features such as search, filtering by order status, and other sorting options would greatly assist users in managing and tracking their transactions more effectively.\n\n5. It is important to consider that many companies already have existing processes in place for recycling or selling their waste materials. The proposal does not clearly articulate how this platform would improve or transform existing practices. As it stands, the value proposition for both buyers and sellers is unclear. The solution appears to be over-engineered without offering a compelling improvement over current methods.",

    "comments": "The project's objective of creating a complete and interactive platform for phishing education, awareness, and detection is a little\u00a0common. Several practical difficulties may have an impact on the project's viability in the actual world. Many educational programmes experience significant dropout rates, and without a defined plan for maintaining user engagement, Phish Trainer may face similar challenges.\nThe platform's efficacy is dependent on the quality and relevancy of its content. Phishing strategies vary quickly, and keeping training materials current with the latest threats and methodologies necessitates ongoing work and resources. If the material gets old, the platform's value plummets dramatically.\nFurthermore, the success of phishing education is strongly dependent on realistic simulations and scenarios. Developing realistic and diverse phishing simulators that can adapt to different user situations and give appropriate learning opportunities is difficult and time-consuming.\nIn conclusion, while Phish Trainer is a common project, its actual execution confronts issues such as user engagement, content relevancy, realistic simulations, accessibility, and effect measurement. Addressing these problems is critical to the project's viability and success in the real world.",

They have a grasp and knowledge to develop an application, even though they may be lacking some depth in specific front or back end skills. \n\nThe things I don't like about this project is the UI/UX experience. It feels a bit patchworky, and not very intuitive as their lacks a consistency between design elements and workflows. It seems more like a portal to different feature sets that were developed by different teams, which makes sense since the engineer utilizes some third party services and libraries to build this app. My recommendation here is to come up with a design system and apply that to all of your components, and that will really help the feel of the project. Unfortunately, the UI can be a big impact on first arrivals, and my impact as an end user is it may be a bit clunky and lack the intuitive design elements I have come to enjoy in more developed applications.\n\nThe parts I do like are the idea. While it is not necessarily unique, it is a great starting point for a SaaS company. Pick a target audience and build a CMS style application they can use to manage their workflows. With some polish on the front end, this could be pitched to design agencies as a service they can use to interact with their clients, and then by designing new features as requested by customers you could start to have a software as a service pipeline in place. It fits an industry already in place and just gives them a new tool, which is great for new products. ",

It includes visual analytics and allows filtering by subject, lecture, and other breakdowns. The idea is practical and shows understanding of how AI can help in educational environments.\n\nHowever, in terms of critical impact, the tool feels more like a supportive add-on than a must-have system. While it improves the way feedback is presented, the core idea is not entirely new, and similar functions could possibly be achieved with existing tools and structured surveys. That said, applying AI for automatic summarization and categorization is a good learning exercise and shows the students' ability to apply natural language processing concepts effectively.\n\nOne concern with the presentation is the background music, which was too loud and made it difficult to follow the speaker. For future presentations, better audio balancing would help in delivering the message more clearly.\n\nOverall, this is a well-executed concept with thoughtful implementation, though the practical impact may be limited.",

The system offers a user-friendly interface and aligns well with national agricultural goals and sustainability efforts. Its potential impact is notable, especially with proposed features like real-time image analysis, treatment guidance, and scalability for wider adoption. The business model is well thought out, highlighting opportunities for partnerships and retail integrations. However, the absence of a working demo and lack of technical details\u2014such as dataset size, model performance, and AI model structure\u2014limit the ability to fully assess its effectiveness. Streamlining repetitive content and expanding disease detection capabilities would further strengthen the project. Overall, it shows strong potential for practical use and future development. Also, a use case should be done on historical data, example: how can we track which history to look for looking at a plant, if there are multiple histories?\n\nAll the best !!! Great work",

    "comments": "This project delivers a web-based dashboard for air quality analysis and prediction using Streamlit. It allows users to upload sensor datasets and performs basic data cleaning, feature generation, and regression-based forecasting using off-the-shelf machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Trees). The dashboard includes visualization features, pollutant-level prediction, and Air Quality Index (AQI) labeling, along with SHAP visualizations to explain model predictions.\n\nFrom a development standpoint, the project is functional and technically competent, showcasing familiarity with data preprocessing, machine learning pipelines, and dashboard development. The interface is user-friendly and supports exploratory data analysis workflows. However, the technical depth and innovation are limited.\n\nThe system relies solely on static sensor data and basic baseline regression models. There is no novel algorithmic contribution, nor any complex modeling approach beyond widely used regressors. Real-time streaming, advanced time-series techniques, or adaptive forecasting are absent. Similarly, the AQI classification and PM2.5 \u201cGood/Bad\u201d labeling use conventional thresholds without adding intelligent interpretation or actionable insights.\n\nWhile the dashboard serves as a good educational tool for demonstrating basic ML applications in environmental data, it does not break new ground in either system design or methodology. The project reflects a standard applied data science approach, and would benefit from integration with real-time IoT feeds or the inclusion of predictive alerts and recommendations.\n\n",

    "comments": "Your project effectively identifies a significant problem for small farming organizations, with your use of a storytelling technique commendably explaining both the problem and the proposed solution's relevance, providing a strong foundation for your work. For future efforts, consider reinforcing your problem statement with specific statistical data on the impact.\n\nThe ambition to integrate IoT, LLMs, and CNNs into a comprehensive solution is highly commendable. However, for a first version, the inherent complexity with numerous components and external services, including two cloud providers without clear justification, raises concerns about practicality and cost. More explicit details on your CNN's training data and how it distinctly analyzes images, differentiating its role from the LLM, are crucial. Additionally, clarifying the specific knowledge base leveraged by your RAG implementation and how it directly enhances the LLM's agricultural insights would strengthen your solution. I strongly suggest simplifying the initial scope to focus on one core valuable issue (e.g., automated irrigation) to prove viability and reduce costs. For enhanced usability, consider implementing a feature that automatically suggests default optimal growth condition values for specific plant types.\n\nYour pitch was well-structured with advanced visuals and good storytelling. However, the fast pace made it challenging to follow complex details, and loud background music was distracting. Practice a more measured pace and ensure audio does not interfere with your clear delivery.\n\nThe entrepreneurial vision is clear, with well-considered monetization strategies and a creative integration of AI and IoT as a unique selling proposition. Yet, the solution's complexity and potential high costs could impede market entry for small-to-medium farmers. Focus on a streamlined, cost-effective MVP for initial commercialization and develop a more comprehensive go-to-market strategy.\n\nOverall, your dedication to this ambitious project is evident, and FarmTab AI represents a highly promising solution. Congratulations on your excellent work, and keep innovating!",

Solution is somewhat good, but does not replicate the real world traffic jam scenario shown in the video nor does it show how changing the roads or traffic rules solves that. Also, does not explain clearly why an existing advanced game/simulation like Cities: Skyline cannot be modded with custom map, traffic mods etc. to recreate the scenario? For example, existing traffic/city simulation games offer different types of roads and traffic rules to be specified, how can that be replicated in this solution?",

    "comments": "1. While location-based attendance systems are not a new concept, the implementation of a dual attendance mechanism within a single class session is a creative and commendable approach. This feature adds a layer of accountability and may offer practical benefits in specific learning environments.\n\n2. To justify the proposed subscription fee of RM39.99 per month, especially in the context of higher education institutions, the application should ideally offer a broader range of features beyond attendance tracking. Without added value, the cost may be seen as high and could ultimately be passed on to students, raising concerns about affordability.\n\n3. The use of in-app advertisements may not be practical in time-sensitive scenarios. For instance, if a student is arriving just before class begins, the need to watch an ad before marking attendance could create unnecessary delays and friction in the user experience.\n\n4. The application does not appear to address potential misuse through GPS spoofing or fake location apps, which poses a risk to the integrity of the attendance data. Implementing measures to detect or prevent location manipulation would significantly strengthen the system\u2019s reliability and credibility.\n\n5. There is also no discussion on integration with existing school systems. It would be helpful to clarify how lecturers can export or synchronize students' data and attendance data with the school\u2019s official system to ensure seamless administrative processes.",

Clarifying this would help justify the architecture and cost model more convincingly.\n\nAlso, while the demo successfully displayed real-time device readings, the analytics module didn\u2019t go far enough to impress stakeholders. Simply showing raw metrics isn\u2019t always meaningful. To make a stronger impact, the app could process those metrics into actionable insights\u2014like detecting anomalies, tracking rehab progress over time, or generating alerts for therapists. That kind of value-added interpretation is what really captures attention.\n\nAlso i understand that there may not be enough time to do what i mentioned above. anyway, it's a good project.",

When it comes to solutioning, the demonstration is more like a house maintainance report, but not so much about new house handover defects management. The apps will be very useful if it appears to be mobile apps, and the user can just tap on the location on the digital floormap and snap photo directly. Hence, usability point of view, it can be further improved. The tech stack selection is fine and a plus point leveraging Firebase managed services. When it comes to entrepreneurship, it is true that demand is there, however there is also plenty of house inspector services that offers home inspection and produced professional report to the developer. I am giving a credit to entrepreneurship as the business model is explained.",

    "comments": "This project presents a solid foundation for a dark web monitoring tool aimed at SOCs. Automating the extraction of leaked data\u2014such as credentials, credit card info, and API keys\u2014from dark web sources is a valuable capability. If executed well, this system could support threat intelligence, digital forensics, and early breach detection.\n\nHowever, the current scope appears too broad. \"Scanning the entire dark web\" is neither practical nor secure. Much of the dark web is private or intentionally hidden. A more focused approach\u2014targeting known marketplaces, forums, and paste sites\u2014would be more effective and safer.\n\nClarify who this tool is for. Is it meant for national security teams, enterprise SOCs, or law enforcement? Each has very different use cases. For example, government users may value national threat intel, while businesses care more about leaked internal credentials.\n\nUsing Tor and Playwright raises concerns. Tor helps with anonymity but doesn\u2019t make crawling safe by default. Advanced threat actors can detect and fingerprint crawlers. Playwright is great for automation but wasn\u2019t built for adversarial environments. You\u2019ll need to harden your infrastructure to avoid exposure.\n\nAlso, consider the legal and ethical implications. Scraping dark web content\u2014especially in real-time\u2014requires careful handling to avoid unintentionally interacting with illegal material or entrapment sites.\n\nIn summary, this project has strong potential as a dark web observation and extraction tool. To improve it:\n\nDefine a clear target audience and use case.\n\nNarrow the scope to specific dark web sources.\n\nStrengthen operational security and crawler anonymity.\n\nReframe the tool as part of a larger threat intelligence pipeline.\n\n\nWith these adjustments, the system could become a useful asset for cyber defense and forensic teams.\n\n",

Great job!\nTo further enhance the product\u2019s value and usability, I\u2019d suggest considering a few additional pain points from the perspective of both teachers and parents:\nSmart Alerts: In a teacher\u2019s busy schedule, it's easy to miss updates. Timely alert notifications can help remind them to update attendance, feedback, or progress.\nInstitutional Integration: Connecting the app with existing university/school databases could eliminate the need for manual child registration and allow automatic syncing of course details, class schedules, etc.\nBy identifying and addressing more practical pain points, you can increase both the impact of the solution and its business potential.

    "comments": "Quite an interesting project, good problem statement, can see that research has been done on the problem itself and competitions in the market.\n\nSolution is great, but there are several questions to be answered:\n1) How does this project helps in reducing number of scams? Scammer can just create a fake profile or impersonate a valid business using their address and logo, there is no way for house owner to verify this, they will probably still need to go through some research themselves, which kind of defeat the purpose of this platform. Unless there are some mechanism e.g. paying deposit to the platform and platform only release on work done or there are other form of verification, this is still an issue to be addressed.\n2) AI service recommendation for house owner is a good idea but in the presentation it seems like the advanced filtering is good enough for house owner to find the services available, which bring me to my next point\n3) The revenue model for house owner is a little unrealistic, how do you keep track on the 3 times trial of AI service recommendation in free tier, does that mean the user have to create an account just to view the listing? Since the focus of this platform is on renovation, monthly subscription based model does not make sense for house owner because how many times would an average person need a renovation service in a lifetime?\n\nThe idea of integrating AI into the system to write summary and for recommendation is great nevertheless, slides are well prepared despite some typo.\n",

    "comments": "1. Regarding the analysis tool, it would be more effective if it were designed to automatically retrieve relevant data from the patient's medical records, rather than relying on manual input. Ideally, the analysis should run upon user interaction (e.g., clicking a button), ensuring consistency, reducing user error, and improving workflow efficiency.\n\n2. In the current demonstration, allowing the Medical Officer to modify personal details such as name, marital status, and height raises concerns around data integrity. While it is beneficial to provide control and editing functionality, these actions should be supported by robust access controls and logging mechanisms to ensure accountability and traceability.\n\n3. To enhance the system\u2019s practical value, it is recommended to present more medically relevant information instead of general demographic data. The system should clearly demonstrate how it supports Medical Officers or healthcare professionals in general in visualizing and interpreting clinical information. The sample charts included in the demo are currently too brief to illustrate the full potential of the system.\n\n4. The pitch and video presentation are exceptionally well-executed, reflecting a high level of professionalism and communication skill. However, the core solution presented appears too brief and lacks the depth typically required to address real-world needs in the medical field. Given the complexity and regulatory nature of healthcare, further development is needed to align the solution with practical, clinical, and compliance-related considerations.",

Get practical usage inputs from users, such as security. E.g. after an emergency is logged, what is the next practical step ? Integration to security guard's system? Integrating to CCTV locations in order to improve response time ? Is there a need to differentiate the types of emergencies ? \n2. Improve the reliability of the system. Where are the locations that are most useful for these ? How to keep the hardware functional with minimal maintenance and make it tamper resistant ? How to reduce/remove false alarms ?\n\nKeep up the great work.",

    "comments": "The project delivers the expected features and addresses a potentially useful service. However, several key assumptions are not sufficiently validated. It is unclear why high-performing students (CGPA 3.5 and above) would choose to tutor through the platform rather than pursue better-paying part-time tutoring opportunities externally. The proposal also lacks data or research to demonstrate clear demand for tutoring services among university-level students, which is critical to justify the platform's relevance. Furthermore, the willingness of top-performing students to participate as tutors remains uncertain. There is also a high likelihood that, once a tutor-student connection is made, users may bypass the platform to avoid service fees. Lastly, with the rising accessibility of AI tools and large language models (LLMs), it is questionable whether students still prefer in-person tutoring. While the proposed features are generally in place, the business model and long-term viability need stronger justification.\n\n",

    "comments": "This project addresses an important problem in industries that rely on strict environmental control, such as pharmaceuticals, cold storage, and manufacturing. However, the overall concept feels quite general. One of the strengths of the system is its use of AI to predict environmental trends. Predictive analytics can help in early detection of failures, which is definitely useful. However, this idea is already being applied in many existing monitoring systems. To stand out, the team should clearly explain what makes their predictive model or approach differently, whether it is accuracy, speed, customization, or integration flexibility. Without that, the innovation may come across as limited, even if technically well-built. It was also difficult to fully understand the product's direction. If the intention is to sell this as a system, then more clarity is needed on the value proposition and what problem it solves better than current tools. If it is just a framework showcase, then the innovation is not particularly new.",

Your module diagrams were easy to understand and made sense. I thought that your architecture diagram could benefit from showing that the connection between your two deployment locations is encrypted. Any data that is transferred over the internet must always be encrypted.\n\nImplementing Stripe is a great choice.  Your barter system was innovative and will definitely create a niche for your product in some markets. I liked the idea of comparing the value of the two skill offerings and applying a discount.  And again, the UI for this process was very well thought out and clear.\n\nI believe that your solution solves the problem you described, but there are real-world practicalities that you didn't discuss. You didn't mention the existence of an admin panel and I think that if this solution were deployed you would need one. For example, I can imagine that in real life you will need to have some sort of appeals system for the situation where a barter occurs and one party does not deliver.  \n\nI understand that this feature and the admin panel would be a large scope to include in your project, but I feel you should have mentioned it to show that you have considered it. \n\nI think you understate the potential impact of this system. For example, it could help unbanked people in remote areas to streamline their local economy.",

Probably twice for health checkup, twice for dental checkup, normally we visit doctor straight away when we feel sick, we can't really predict when will we be sick in the future and make appointment in advance.\n  2) rescheduling using app would be extremely hard because it needs the agreement of both parties, imagine the amount of notifications the doctor will get to cater for the appointment of all the patients under him/her on reschedule.\n  3) scheduling appointment are usually done by admin/nurse, pushing this job to doctor doesn't really help \n- description and instruction of use of medication is usually printed on the medication itself, there is no reason for needing an extra app to keeping track of that\n\nThat said, the use of QR code to check in is a good idea which can smoothen the registration process in clinic. Notification on when to take medication and keeping medication history on oneself is also another great idea. ",

It should be said that similar solutions that integrate with, or are part of existing platforms also exist in the market. The presenter may also be able to add a bit of details into what kind of setup will be necessary if this were to be released as a SaaS offering.

Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors!\n\nHere are some suggestions to further improve your project:\n\nInnovation Scope:\nWhile the concept is valuable, similar IoT-based farming systems already exist. I encourage you to research current solutions and identify specific gaps that your system can address. This will add uniqueness and relevance.\n\nAI Integration:\nExplore integrating modern technologies like LLMs (Large Language Models) for predictive insights and sowing recommendations. In today\u2019s landscape, even software engineers are expected to understand and apply AI concepts.\n\nFlexibility:\nThe system is currently tomato-specific. Making it crop-agnostic with configurable settings will widen its applicability. You can also consider adding a crop dataset integration to support farmers with better decisions.\n\nArchitecture & Connectivity:\nThe architecture should be clearer. Since you're using an ESP32 (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth), please explain how the sensor data reaches Firebase. This clarity improves the technical depth.\n\nReal-time Updates:\nRefreshing the UI every 3 seconds is okay, but real-time protocols like MQTT or WebSockets would provide better performance. Firebase's real-time features are also worth exploring.\n\nHarvest Data Input:\nManual data entry can be a burden for farmers. Consider how this data could be made easier to record or used to provide valuable insights to encourage participation.\n\nPresentation:\nKindly improve the ending of the video presentation for a stronger closing impact.\n\nKeep up the good work and continue refining your ideas!\n\nBest regards,\nThiru",

You\u2019ve clearly identified a real challenge in mobile app security testing: manual processes, lack of centralized management, and inconsistent reporting, and your solution brings together powerful tools into a unified, semi-automated workflow. The Pentester Dashboard and modular approach make your system practical and scalable, and your focus on both static and dynamic analysis is well thought out.\n\nYour project stands out for its practicality and potential impact, especially for security teams and pentesters who need efficient, reliable tools. The entrepreneurial potential is strong, with possibilities for productization, SaaS deployment, and use in cybersecurity training.\n\nFor your presentation skills, I noticed your pitch was quite fast-paced - perhaps you were worried about time. Try to slow down, take it step by step, and remember to pause and breathe. This will help your audience follow along and absorb the information you\u2019re sharing. Even I found it a bit challenging to keep up at times! A more measured pace will make your delivery clearer and more engaging.\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve done excellent work both technically and in communicating your ideas. With a bit more attention to pacing and clarity in your delivery, your future presentations will be even stronger. Keep it up!",

    "comments": "SkinGuard is a well-thought-out mHealth app targeting a real and underserved need using AI and user-driven data tracking. It blends innovation with practical healthcare impact, especially in areas with limited access to dermatology services.\n\nTo enhance the impact and credibility of SkinGuard, integrating medical validation is essential. Partnering with certified dermatologists or healthcare institutions would ensure that the AI-driven recommendations and chatbot responses are clinically sound, which would help build user trust. Furthermore, clearly communicating how personal health data is securely handled would address privacy concerns and increase user confidence, especially when dealing with sensitive images and information.\n\nFrom a presentation standpoint, enhancing the delivery tone can significantly improve audience engagement. The presenter could work on vocal modulation\u2014using more expressive tone, strategic pauses, and varied pacing to highlight key ideas. Avoiding or simplifying technical jargon can also make the pitch more accessible to a general audience.\n\nAs an added layer of potential, the app could eventually evolve into a broader ecosystem. For example, introducing a \u201cfamily mode\u201d would allow users to track and manage the skin health of loved ones, such as children or elderly parents. This would increase the app\u2019s value proposition, particularly in family-oriented communities.",

    "comments": "This project tackles a socially important issue\u2014scam awareness\u2014by developing an AI-driven application with two user modes. One mode is designed for government agencies to create and post scam-related content on social media (such as Facebook and X), then collect and analyze user interactions. The second mode allows public users to view, share, and engage with those posts. The backend AI engine uses sentiment analysis and text classification to categorize scams and provide insights into public reactions.\n\nThe idea is relevant and timely, especially given the rising number of scams. The application of AI is practical and focused, and the insights generated can help government agencies improve their communication strategies and public outreach.\n\nThe presentation was well-timed and clear, although the background music was slightly too loud, making it harder to hear the speaker at times. Better audio control would improve the delivery.\n\nOne limitation is on the user side\u2014requiring users to log in just to view or share government posts may discourage usage. Removing the login requirement or supporting social login (e.g., Google or Facebook) could make the app more user-friendly. Alternatively, encouraging the public to follow official social media accounts might be a simpler approach for awareness.\n\nThis is more of a social benefit project rather than a commercially viable product. Its primary adopter would likely be a government agency, which means opportunities for entrepreneurship or market expansion may be limited. Still, the project's public value and potential impact on awareness and prevention are strong.",

Your project addresses a real gap in cryptography education by making classical ciphers accessible and understandable for beginners. The combination of interactive tools, clear explanations, quizzes, and a history log creates a strong learning environment that bridges theory and practice. The platform is thoughtfully designed for different user types and is practical for both classroom and self-study use.\n\nFor your presentation, you explained the features and technical aspects clearly, and your demonstrations were easy to follow. To make your future presentations even stronger, try to slow down your delivery and take it step by step. At times, your pitch felt a bit fast-paced, perhaps you were trying to fit everything in, but pausing and breathing will help your audience absorb the information more easily. This will make your communication even more effective and engaging.\n\nOverall, ClassiCrypt is a promising project with real educational value and potential for further development. Keep up the great work!",

    "comments": "The integration of Electronic Health Records (EHR) with blockchain capabilities such as decentralised storage, immutability, and smart contracts is noteworthy, demonstrating a commitment to using cutting-edge technology to improve healthcare systems.\nHowever, various practical issues may jeopardise the project's real-world application and viability. To begin, while blockchain technology has theoretical advantages in terms of confidentiality and immutability, its deployment in healthcare systems presents considerable hurdles. Blockchain integration with current healthcare infrastructure may be hard and costly, necessitating significant technical skills and financial resources that many providers may lack.\nMoreover, the decentralised nature of blockchain may provide regulatory and compliance problems. Healthcare data is subject to strict rules and privacy legislation, including HIPAA in the United States. Ensuring that a blockchain-based system complies with these rules while ensuring data privacy and security is a difficult and constant challenge.\nFurthermore, the usefulness of blockchain technology for both healthcare practitioners and patients must be carefully considered. While the initiative seeks to increase usability, blockchain systems can be intrinsically complicated, necessitating extensive user education and adaption. Making the system user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users is critical for wider adoption.\nIn summary, while the notion of utilising blockchain technology to safeguard healthcare information is unique and has significant benefits, the project's practical implementation confronts integration, scalability, regulatory compliance, usability, and acceptance issues. Addressing these problems is critical to ensuring the project's success and feasibility in the real world.",

It is not yet clear how the project effectively mitigates or manages this challenge. For instance, situations such as peer-led boycotts may compromise the integrity of evaluations. A more robust mechanism is needed to ensure fairness and impartiality in peer assessments.\n\nUser Experience Enhancements While the user experience demonstrates a solid foundation, the dashboard could benefit from additional features. Specifically, enabling users to better slice and dice the data\u2014for example, filtering by categories, timeframes, or peer groups\u2014would significantly enhance usability and analytical value.\n\nComment Functionality The inclusion of a comment section is a commendable step toward fostering peer interaction and feedback. However, the current implementation does not appear to leverage these inputs effectively. To maximize its impact, consider integrating comment analysis or linking comments to evaluation outcomes in a meaningful way.",

The idea of real-time factory monitoring is both relevant and impactful.\nHowever, to make the solution truly real-time, it\u2019s important to demonstrate how live data is captured, for example, using actual temperature sensors or external APIs. Currently, it seems the data updates are simulated rather than sensor-driven.\n\nSome suggestions to improve the project further:\nIntegrate real-time data using sensors or appropriate hardware interfaces.\nEnhance the graphics and UI to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.\nInclude dynamic updates such as day/night modes and weather conditions based on system inputs.\nAdd a presentation slides to clearly explain your architecture and workflow.\n\nYou're on the right track, refining these areas will significantly improve the project\u2019s credibility and completeness.

Your problem statement was clear and supported by impactful statistics, which really helped set the stage for why this project matters.\n\nYour solution is practical and user-friendly, especially with the web-based interface and the educational module. I appreciate how you integrated learning resources and quizzes to help users understand malware risks better, this adds value beyond just detection. The modular design shows good planning and makes the system scalable for future improvements.\n\nThat said, since you\u2019re relying mainly on signature-based detection, which you also pointed out has limitations, it would be great to see how you might incorporate more advanced detection methods in the future, such as behavioral analysis or AI/ML techniques. This could really boost and uplift the innovativeness and effectiveness of MalGuard.\n\nYour project has strong entrepreneurial potential, especially as an educational tool for non-technical users and training programs. It\u2019s clear you\u2019ve thought about practical applications and impact, which is excellent.\n\nFor your future presentations, I\u2019d encourage you to limit the amount of text on your slides. Try to use concise bullet points or keywords, and then elaborate verbally. This helps keep your audience engaged and ensures they focus on your explanation rather than reading the slides. Also, when you introduce technical terms or modules, take a moment to explain what each one means in simple terms - this will help everyone follow along. Vary your tone and energy for a more engaging, impactful presentation delivery\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve created a very promising foundation with MalGuard. With some further development on detection capabilities and perhaps exploring partnerships or certification programs, this project could have an even greater impact. Keep up the good work\u2014you\u2019re on the right track!",

Moreover, these are too private details for an end user; we need some security measures here to protect this information.\n\nI see potential if this can be a SAAS based application which can be white labelled for travel agencies where they have clients as users. Currently, travel agencies more or less follow paper-based or email-based communication with clients. This can be a better alternative where they can plan and send it for approval to clients, while clients can suggest their alternatives and booking confirmation can be propagated. Client will have their own little space, optionally like budget etc.\n\nMost of the places the UX was top notch, some places to take care of where on-click navigation exists is to provide an indication that something exists on click. Also, as there is too much data entry, consider a data import mechanism.",

However, it did not meet my basic expectations.\n\nThe solution needs to address the intelligent component (slide page 11) and explain how each component works. It would be even better if you included how data is shared interchangeably among components. You mentioned a neural network being used as a component, but unfortunately, the project owner did not cite any references (e.g., the specific model used, the source of the model).\n\nIf these points are addressed, it will significantly enhance the presentation.\n\nA few minutes were spent explaining User Authentication & Profile Management at the very beginning of the presentation. This approach diverted my focus from understanding the solution better. The presenter should have jumped directly into explaining the solution and how it works.\n\nI believe the idea is decent and should be applauded, even though it is not an entrepreneurial-worthy solution.",

    "comments": "Understanding:\nEduBuddy is a well-thought-out project aimed at supporting early childhood education in Malaysia, specifically for children aged 4 to 6. The application aligns with the national preschool curriculum (KSPK) and covers three key areas of learning: reading, writing, and counting. It's a nicely structured solution with a clear understanding of both educational needs and technical implementation.\n\nVerdict:\nThe project demonstrates good use of AI technologies. The speech recognition module, which evaluates pronunciation of suku kata using MFCC features and deep learning, shows a solid grasp of applying AI in a meaningful way. On the other side, the tracing recognition module does real-time analysis of stroke movement and compares it with templates, which is quite relevant for guiding early handwriting development.\n\nAlthough the current demo only shows the basic exercises, the technical direction is promising. If it\u2019s expanded with more interactive content and tested further with actual users, it could definitely become a valuable tool for preschools and parents. It also has decent entrepreneurial potential\u2014this kind of platform, if polished and localized well, can find space in the growing EdTech market.\n\nOverall, a solid project with practical value, clear educational focus, and good application of AI in multiple areas.",

However, the chart designed for parents could be further enhanced to include more detailed and actionable insights. At present, it appears too brief and lacks depth, limiting its usefulness for parental engagement and follow-up.\n\n2. The pricing structure may need to be reconsidered. Classifying a school with 26 to 50 students as \u201cmedium-sized\u201d seems inaccurate, as such schools are typically considered small. Similarly, the definition of large schools may need refinement. Aligning pricing tiers more closely with realistic school sizes would make the solution more accessible and fair.\n\n3. Further elaboration is needed on how the gamified quizzes align with the Ministry of Education (MOE) curriculum. Clarifying this alignment would strengthen the platform\u2019s relevance and credibility in formal education settings.\n\n4. While the platform presents a solid foundation, it would benefit from a more in-depth explanation of how it specifically supports students with learning disabilities. Currently, it resembles a conventional learning system. To truly differentiate it, the proposal should highlight tailored features or methodologies that enhance the learning experience and efficiency for students with diverse learning needs.",

Additionally, incorporating more dynamic tone variation and reducing reliance on reading directly from the slides would enhance engagement and clarity.\n\n2. The presentation currently contains a significant amount of on-screen text. To improve audience comprehension and retention, it would be beneficial to incorporate more visual elements such as illustrations, icons, or infographics to complement the key messages.\n\n3. If the application is intended for use by the broader Muslim community, offering multilingual support beyond Malay would greatly increase its accessibility and inclusivity. This would allow it to benefit a wider range of users across different regions and language backgrounds.\n\n4. The features presented reflect thoughtful consideration of user needs, particularly the functionalities for tracking the journey, highlighting significant landmarks, and assisting with the recitation and practice of doa during umrah. These elements add meaningful value to the user experience.",

For a large enterprise with many position and different JD, HR is very hard to know all requirements. This definitely can help HR a lot. If the training course can be auto pulling from internet instead of manual search and add by HR, it will be more productive.\n> The dashboard with analysis is quite useful for HR to understand the situation.\n> The UI/UX design is very practical and experienced.

Aimed at supporting rural durian farmers, the system allows users to upload leaf images to automatically identify disease symptoms, enabling early intervention and potentially reducing crop loss.\n\nTechnically, the project demonstrates sound knowledge of computer vision and deep learning deployment. The choice of YOLOv8 ensures accurate image-based detection, and the use of a web interface improves accessibility for non-technical users. It is a well-built academic prototype showcasing an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.\n\nHowever, the solution is not innovative. Plant disease detection using CNN and YOLO variants has been widely applied in many agricultural contexts, and this project does not introduce novel modeling, automation strategies, or decision support features beyond detection.\n\nA bigger concern lies in real-world practicality. In large durian plantations, disease symptoms appear across hundreds or thousands of trees, making manual photo capture or camera-based monitoring highly impractical. The project lacks consideration for deployment scale, infrastructure needs (e.g. camera count, angles, mobility), and environmental constraints such as lighting and weather.\n\nWithout an efficient data collection method\u2014like drone integration, mobile-based scanning, or edge AI sensors\u2014the system is unlikely to be scalable or usable in actual farm operations.",

However, the platform still feels like it is in a mid-stage of development. The platform includes a review feature for donation points, but it currently lacks engagement strategies that would attract users to actively browse, interact, or contribute. If the goal is to build a vibrant ecosystem of giving, the platform could benefit from features like donation highlights, social sharing tools, trending causes, or user stories to create more visibility and momentum. Overall, the project is built on a solid and meaningful foundation. With improved user experience, richer engagement features, and end-to-end functionality, this system could grow into a powerful tool for donation management and community support.",

    "comments": "Your approach to governing access via Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with fuzzy logic is commendable and forward-thinking.\nPros\nSNACS truly shines with its context-aware ABAC and fuzzy logic, enabling granular, real-time access decisions. This aligns perfectly with the \"just-in-time, just-enough\" access principles that are crucial today. The centralized architecture provides unified oversight, essential for managing the explosion of non-human identities and curbing shadow IT. Integrating behavioral analytics adds a vital layer of adaptive security, allowing SNACS to detect anomalies and respond dynamically. Lastly, a well-designed central dashboard is key for practical deployment, simplifying the management of diverse non-human assets.\n\nCons (Challenges for Enterprise Readiness)\nDespite its strengths, SNACS faces significant hurdles for real-world enterprise adoption. Relying on easily spoofable attributes like IP or location makes the system vulnerable to contextual spoofing, compromising its security guarantees. Integration complexity with existing identity systems (like Active Directory, SAML, OAuth) is a major concern; seamless operation without disrupting current authentication flows is non-negotiable. Scalability and User Experience (UX) need considerable work; without robust search and pagination, managing large datasets of non-human entities becomes quickly unfeasible. Finally, policy management requires serious enhancement\u2014features like versioning, audit trails, and rollback capabilities are fundamental for compliance and preventing misconfigurations.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement\nTo elevate SNACS from a promising academic prototype to an enterprise-grade solution, focus on these areas:\n * Enhance Threat Resilience: Implement stronger, multi-factor contextual attributes and deeply integrate behavioral anomaly scores into the risk assessment.\n * Streamline Integration: Develop standardized APIs and out-of-the-box connectors for common IAM platforms.\n * Optimize Scalability and UX: Prioritize intuitive UI/UX with robust search, filtering, and bulk operation capabilities.\n * Strengthen Policy Governance: Implement comprehensive version control, approval workflows, and detailed auditing for all policies.\nSNACS is a fantastic start, demonstrating a clear understanding of future IAM demands. .\n",

The navigation demonstration of your prototype was well-executed and clearly showcased the core capabilities.\n\nTo further strengthen this project, I suggest expanding on the scalability aspect. A demonstration or clear explanation of how the system would manage multiple AMR units interacting with each other, along with optimized task allocation, would significantly enhance its appeal. Additionally, more detailed work on seamless integration with existing Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) is crucial. This would illustrate a practical pathway for adoption and highlight how your solution aligns with broader Industry 4.0 principles in a live environment. Continued focus on these areas will elevate the project's impact and commercial viability.",

Time challenge game also was done well with perhaps some synchronization of notes / display in front of the character and ensure the visibility using right choice of fonts size and color again. Of course, to pay attention to right sentences and grammar usage. \nWell done! \n\nI would like to explore further on potential of bringing similar VR system into my organization and open for immediate discussion.",

And its not just a prototype, but it has potential to reach various remote areas where medical assistance is not easily accessible due to physical constraints including small hospitals.

It manages to help lecturer reduce their workload, it can be the darling for every lecturer around.\n\nHowever, when digging deep into the implementation, the Language Performance element somehow becomes irrelevant. Students nowadays will push their boundaries by utilizing AI chatbots, to help them to get their assignments done. Hence, this feature might not be the USP (unique selling proposition) for the project.\n\nThe grading feature is good, even though I wonder how Semaklah can optimize the lecturer's time in marking the students' assignments if the class consists of more than 20 students. Repetition can kill productivity, and that is what i can see when grading the students' assignments.\n\nIf Semaklah can build an additional feature; an automated grading feature, that would be a game-changer. A software that is so smart, it can recommend the score for each question. That will make the lecturers' lives even better.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

It might have been more effective to focus on a specific set of habits or categorize them with distinct features. This is just my opinion. The app itself is well-designed, with a good UI. However, targeting only iOS users limits the audience; expanding to other platforms could be beneficial.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nThe features are quite limited, and there are many existing task management apps. Incorporating unique, innovative features that target specific habits would make the app stand out. For example, if focusing on reading as a habit, suggesting books or book clubs could add value.\nThe pitch was good and concise. The UI is simple and clean, and the application architecture is solid.",

Its technical foundation is solid\u2014leveraging YOLOv8 and cloud offloading for efficiency\u2014and the deployment on Raspberry Pi shows strong practicality for budget-sensitive environments.\n\nTo enhance the system, future iterations should focus on language clarity and visual storytelling. The pitch is rich in content but lacks fluent delivery, which may hinder investor or stakeholder confidence. Rehearsing with clearer English narration or adding subtitles could make the message more impactful.\n\nFrom a product perspective, the team should explore commercial viability: Will the system work in low-light, underwater glare, or crowded pool conditions? Adding redundancy via multiple sensors or combining with sound monitoring could improve reliability. Consider a business model (e.g., SaaS dashboard for facilities, subscription alerts for parents) to elevate its entrepreneurial pitch. Real-time testing in various environmental conditions and collaboration with lifeguards or public safety bodies would also increase credibility and value.\n\nWith improved pitch delivery and real-world pilot data, this project has high potential for both social impact and market adoption.",

Pieces stands out by combining cutting-edge AI and genuine human-centered design in a way that renders it not just a mental health tool but also a compassionate companion on the user's path of personal growth. So its  a great example of how technology can be leveraged in a positive way to support emotional well-being and proactive mental health care.",

Without this verification, it gives the impression that the system might be interacting only with a local database or frontend interface, rather than managing real infrastructure. Demonstrating the actual effect of the operations on the backend would strengthen the credibility of the implementation.",

In order to match the organisation contribution and users' needs. \n3)  How to ensure there is no duplication of same users accepting different contribution? From this system, perhaps the presenter need to counter measure how to prevent users to abuse the contributions in the app. \n4) Who is the admin to manage the app for organisation and the users? \n5) The database capacity storage of the app. \nFrom the presentation, the app still need to enhance the mechanism on resouces allocation fairly to the needy citizen. \nIn short, the idea is good and it is suitable for non-profit generated business. \n\n",

This cognitive principle is widely supported by learning science and is proven to improve retention and understanding. The core features make sense which create flashcard and organization aligns well with personalized learning. Also, quiz-based testing after flashcard review encourages application of knowledge, reinforcing learning. Good accessibility by being web-based, making it platform-independent, accessible from any device with a browser. I'm glad to see that it's targeting broad use cases from school students to adult learners. \n\nWhile it has high customizability that allow users to create their own content supports self-directed learning and makes the tool adaptable to any subject, I'm sensing the lack of technical depth, maybe it's good to share more on what were the difficulties or challenges encountered while developing the project. Adding some technical implementation details would strengthen the credibility of the work.\n\nSome considerations for future improvement, this would make the platform more useful for diverse subjects and learners.\n- Progress Tracking: Does the system track how many times a user has reviewed or answered a card correctly? This would help users measure improvement and identify weak areas.\n- Collaboration or Sharing: Can users share flashcard decks with others or browse public decks?\n- Visual/Interactive Elements: Could you incorporate images, audio, etc.?\n\nOverall, Flashcard2Learn is a meaningful educational tool grounded in solid learning theory. While the core concept is not novel, its success depends on execution, user experience, and value-added features like tracking, spaced repetition, or collaborative sharing. Good work!",

Your project addresses a meaningful challenge in education and promotes collaborative learning\u2014a key skill in today\u2019s world. Wishing you all the best in your academic and career path!\n\nHere is some constructive feedback that may help improve your project:\n\nScope and Scalability:\nCurrently, the platform focuses specifically on English learning. While this is a strong starting point, I encourage you to explore how the platform could be extended to support other subjects in the future. Thinking ahead will help you build a more scalable and inclusive solution.\n\nCompetitive Research:\nPlatforms like Supernova already exist in the English learning space. Study such platforms to understand what makes them successful and identify opportunities to differentiate your product.\n\nArchitecture & Technical Mapping:\nPlease note that Android Studio is not a framework\u2014it is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Also, in your architecture diagram, Firebase is the backend\u2014not XML. There seems to be some incorrect technology mapping. I highly recommend discussing this with your supervisor, Dr. Lim Chia Yean, to refine the technical structure and improve collaboration on the tech side.\n\nUser Experience & Analytics:\nYour idea of study analytics is very promising. Try to make it more actionable and meaningful for users. A clean and well-structured UI will further enhance the user experience.\n\nGreat initiative overall! Keep iterating and refining your project. Your enthusiasm and effort are clearly visible\u2014stay curious and keep building!\n\nBest regards,\nThiru",

The more data, the more accurate the prediction will be, and will put ML to work effectively. \n\nMost of the presentation aspects are good, providing enough data but not overwhelming. The presentation flow is also good, with highlights along the way of the explanation. \n\nMy only inputs are in the Impact and Benefit and the Entrepreneurship Opportunity. These are almost always the weakest points of most of the presenters. It seems like the Impact and Benefits are showing features instead of the actual implementation benefits that farmers will obtain. For example, farmers will be able to widen their customer base 2X or 3X with the abundance of stock as a result of the sped-up harvesting process. Another example is new variances of the palm oil plants will yield new markets or fulfill new demands with its new properties of features from the accurate breeding mix and match with the aid of Machine Learning, etc, or, the new export requirements for the European market will be met, by formulating the accurate breeding to find certain quality standards, etc.\n\nShow an analysis, an opportunity analysis that clearly outlines the existing market demand. Utilizing the TAM (Total Addressable Market), SAM (Serviceable Available Market), and SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) framework will precisely target and engage your audience. Demonstrate the magnitude of the opportunity by illustrating the market potential at each level, highlighting the significant growth and revenue prospects.\n\n",

It's great that the implementation also involves real-time data syncing, user management, and reporting tools, that further enhances its usability in real-world environments.\n\nFor further development, considerations around data privacy, system scalability, and safety (saw a few failed biometric reads but will continue to let user to try) would strengthen the project. If this includes a detailed evaluation, such as accuracy rates, system limitations, and user feedback, it will show more credibility and critical thinking.\n\nOverall, this project showcases valuable skills in embedded systems, programming, and system design, it could be a strong portfolio piece or even the foundation for a deployable product. However, the idea is not really original and probably easily referenced.",

This offers an edge over many traditional algorithmic trading systems that might rely on simpler models or rule-based algorithms. The capability to autonomously analyze stock movements, generate signals, and execute trades with minimal human intervention is a significant advantage. This can potentially offer higher efficiency and profitability compared to semi-automated systems that require more user input.\n\nProviding educational resources and tutorials on using the platform and understanding the PPO model can help in onboarding users who are unfamiliar with deep learning and reinforcement learning. Further, allowing users to customize the trading parameters and strategies within the PPO framework can attract more advanced traders who prefer having control over their trading systems.",

At its core, the app employs deep learning-based image classification through transfer learning to analyze skin images and classify them into potential categories of skin cancer. This functionality is supported by additional features including a prescription guidance system, personal skin health history tracking, and an AI-powered chatbot for education and prevention tips.\n\nThe project demonstrates clear societal value, addressing a significant healthcare challenge\u2014early skin cancer detection\u2014through accessible, mobile technology. The use of transfer learning is appropriate given the limited size of medical image datasets typically available to student projects, and shows sound understanding of practical AI deployment. The addition of a skin health tracking system reflects a thoughtful approach toward longitudinal monitoring, and the chatbot further supports user engagement and education.\n\nHowever, the project\u2019s critical limitation lies in clinical accuracy, ethical implications, and user safety. Without integration with medical professionals or proper validation datasets, there is a risk of misclassification and potential harm. The \"prescription guidance\" feature must be carefully worded or limited to educational advice to avoid regulatory or legal issues.\n\nDespite these concerns, SkinGuard is a technically ambitious and socially relevant project. Its strength lies in the integration of multiple tools into a single, user-focused platform, rather than introducing novel AI methods.",

It highlights a relevant issue in healthcare, though it could benefit from more supporting research or data to fully convey the scope and impact of the problem. The solution is adequately effective. It combines useful modules (patient management, route optimization, dashboards) that directly address the problem. The project shows some level of innovation, particularly through its application of route optimization algorithms and the integration of KPI dashboards. The project demonstrates potential for real-world impact, with clear benefits for operational efficiency and decision-making. It addresses an important niche in healthcare, but greater detail on scalability and long-term outcomes would strengthen this section. The solution shows some level of practicality, with clear relevance for community nursing. The pitch was clear and structured, but the presenter could enhance confidence and engagement to maximize impact. Overall, a solid project with room for further enhancement. All the best !",

This could potentially be alleviated to some degree by providing API endpoints.\n\nIntegration of Twilio and WhatsApp for notification is very good and is a highlight of the system\n\nThe presenter is very confident though, positioning of the presenter in the video does block some content which were glossed over. Pacing for the first part of presentation was a bit too fast to properly cover everything.

    "comments": "Your project successfully identifies a specific and relevant issue in traditional martial arts training, emphasizing the need for real-time, AI-powered posture correction in Silat Cekak.  The technical foundation of your solution, which uses MoveNet for pose extraction\u00a0and an LSTM model for movement classification, is excellent.  However, to improve its appeal, expanding the system beyond 'Kaedah A' to include more Silat forms or other martial arts would be an important next step.  Furthermore, clarifying the precise interaction of your rule-based feedback and deep learning classification would improve technical clarity.\n\n The innovative use of deep learning for precise, real-time posture correction in a traditional art form like Silat is truly remarkable.  However, widespread real-world practicality require more thorough consideration.  While your web-based architecture is practical, you must have a comprehensive plan in place for extensive accuracy testing across a wide range of users and environments.  Addressing seamless camera integration outside of third-party apps, as well as providing empirical evidence of how your system improves learning outcomes, would greatly increase its viability.\n\nRegarding entrepreneurship, your vision for mobile apps, academy collaborations, and adaptation for other martial arts demonstrates creative thinking. However, the niche market focus and lack of comprehensive market size analysis currently limit the opportunity. Overcoming practical challenges such as extensive validation and scalability will be critical to establishing trust and achieving your high commercialization objectives. I would also encourage you to work on your pitching skills to make your pitch more attractive and clear.\n\nYour enthusiasm for combining technology and traditions is noticeable. Congratulations on using technology to innovate and make social improvements in a field you clearly care about. I strongly encourage you to continue developing your system; with targeted improvements, it has the potential to transform martial arts training.",

In market, there is a few travel superapp like Trip.com can be compete with, furthermore the Student's project's advantage is the customised trip plan that he could put more effort into it or highlight it in the presentation. Unfortunately, he does not explain this feature with more details.\n> The booking part can be better if all related bookings can be linked or tagged under a same trip to allow user's monitor any preparation miss out from the trip plan.\n> The presentation lack of explanation of how the customised itinerary gather user's preference data or how the app gather information to suggest the itinerary.\n> Some UI part could be better such as font colour to allow user read easily.\n> Overall, it is a project with high potential. Looking forward a more automate and informative travel superapp in the market from Kiat Meng.",

The combination of hardware and software, along with a user-friendly mobile app, demonstrates both technical skill and an understanding of user needs. Your focus on affordability and expandability makes the system accessible and attractive for wider adoption.\n\nYour presentation was clear and structured, effectively explaining the system\u2019s architecture and benefits. For future improvement, consider including concrete statistics or case studies to further emphasize the importance of the problem (instead of \"many\", say \"according to a research...\"). Additionally, outlining a roadmap for future features, such as alcohol detection or GPS tracking, could highlight the system\u2019s potential for growth.\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve developed a promising, impactful, and market-ready solution.

    "comments": "Overall, the web app design looks modern and beginner-friendly, but the project concept itself doesn't sound innovative enough, as there are many existing algorithm trading tools and paper trading tools available, and the backtesting part of the project seems to be leveraging the third-party Backtrader library entirely. It would be good if competitive analysis / market analysis is performed and presented. It would also be good if more focus can be put on the backtesting part to showcase the \"Intelligent Computing\" portion of the project, e.g. explaining more about what happens behind the scenes, what drives the backtesting analysis, showing another demo where some actions are actually taken to prove that the logic will really work, etc.\n\nThe presented \"Impact and Benefits\" point of \"fosters the development of technical skills\" doesn't align well with the target users (students and novice traders), especially with the promise of providing them a simple way to perform algorithmic trading. \n\nDuckDB is stated as part of \"Technologies and Stacks\" in this project page, but it's not mentioned in the presentation video, which could lead to confusion.\n\nFor better branding, it would be good if the project thumbnail / highlights could highlight the name of the application (or at least the icon of the application.",

Facial recognition, even for wellness purposes, requires stringent compliance with privacy laws like GDPR and must include user consent, secure data handling, and options to disable such features. Integrating end-to-end encryption and an anonymization layer for emotion data would boost user trust.\n\nAdditionally, while the pitch covered market readiness, expanding on user onboarding strategy and partnerships with universities or health institutions would strengthen its go-to-market plan. A/B testing on content effectiveness, chatbot accuracy, and emotion detection reliability would further validate its success.\n\nFinally, consider an offline mode or low-bandwidth adaptation, especially for under-connected campuses.

While similar commercial solutions exist, the proposed system offers practical value by helping users quickly locate vacant slots in specific areas, potentially reducing search time and easing congestion. The use of AI for license plate recognition is a strong feature, though care should be taken to assess data privacy implications, particularly if license plate data is displayed publicly in the mobile app. I see a promising opportunity for this solution to be deployed in large factory environments with multiple parking zones, guiding employees to available areas efficiently. Additionally, integrating the system with employee pre-registration could eliminate the need for access badges, enhancing automation and convenience. Overall, this is a well-thought-out project with strong potential for real-world application, supported by a clear and confident demonstration.",

If on the other hand the target audience is young adults, the challenge module like the playable character removing obstacle and finding suspicious activities is too easy and uninteresting to them compared too all the other mobile games they have experienced before.\n\nThe idea itself is not really very unique, there are already some awareness campaigns which uses touch screen TV or QR code for interactive knowledge sharing currently, changing those into a mobile game is a good idea but unless it's included into school curriculum I doubt there are a lot of people who will willingly download educational game apps like this.\n\nFurthermore, the solution doesn't really solve the problem statements stated. If it is already stated traditional approach like educational campaign and static website is ineffective, why does the application still use the static website approach (providing a static page with all information) on knowledge sharing module?",

One key strength is its personalization: by tapping into users\u2019 own Spotify data and allowing emotional input, it addresses the frustration of generic playlists effectively. However, there are several areas where the project could be improved.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, exploring more advanced or hybrid models like ensemble learning or deep learning (e.g., random forest or neural nets) might improve accuracy further. Including explainable AI components would allow users to understand why a song matches their mood, building more trust in the system.\n\nOn the entrepreneurship side, the project could benefit from identifying a target market (e.g., Spotify premium users, mental wellness platforms) and suggesting a business model\u2014freemium, SaaS plugin, or partnerships with therapists/music therapists. Finally, including data privacy handling measures (especially since Spotify data is used) would strengthen trust and potential real-world deployment.\n\nOverall, PulsePlay is a solid and practical solution with strong emotional resonance. With more strategic polish and future roadmap clarity, it could stand out as both a useful tool and a scalable product.",

The process is streamlined comprehensively and explained clearly, from role-based usage, admin dashboard, and problem solving (secure and budgeted car pooling journey in consideration of student financial constraint)\n4. The market research, business model is so detailed, revenue projection would be an attractive point to the stakeholder.

The comment section does not seem to help much, nor the important info such as the operation hours are included. Third, the search feature on the mobile application can be improved further, perhaps by giving suggestions based on the user\u2019s last search result.

However, there are quite some work here to do before it is considered ready as a product. The website need to be made in a more modern and intuitive UI and the hardware design need to be finalized.\n\nIdeas to further expand your project :-\n1. Evaluate and compare with products that are offered by other competitors - Are there any similar off-the-shelve hardware that does the same functionalities? That can help you evaluate if this idea can be further made into an actual product, or if the competition is too fierce (too many companies, too low margin), then it may be hard to be commercialized. \n\nGreat work and thank you for your sharing !",

Using Flutter for cross-platform development is a smart choice to maximize reach. Firebase integration (Auth & Firestore) shows good backend knowledge and ensures scalability and secure data handling. Accelerometer-based shake detection is an innovative and intuitive SOS trigger. All and all, the application has well-rounded features like real-time location sharing and automated alerts.\n\nFor presentation wise, the description is clear, concise, and well-structured. The functionality is easy to understand and compelling. Nitpick: Some of the \"slides\" are too wordy, probably can put more picture to visualize the messages instead of reading through the paragraphs.\n\nSome considerations for future improvement\n- Security & Privacy Considerations: How is user data protected, especially location and contact info? Some encryption or data handling policies would strengthen the case.\n- False Positives & Calibration: How do you avoid accidental shake detections?\n- Offline Functionality: Can any part of the app function offline or with limited connectivity? What happens if there\u2019s no data but SMS is available (or vice versa)?\n\nOverall, this is an impressive and thoughtful project with excellent potential for real-world impact. It demonstrates a solid command of both mobile app development and cloud services, while addressing a socially valuable problem. Great work!",

As a result, it\u2019s difficult to assess whether the ML component is fully integrated or just mentioned.\n\nThe overall system appears more like a database management interface to me. \nIt would be helpful to see more evidence of the ML workflow: data preprocessing, model inference, and actual detection outcomes tied to real network traffic. Also, by including a demo of how the system responds to a simulated intrusion or anomaly would significantly strengthen the credibility and practical value of the solution.\n",

    "comments": "(Pros)\nYou gains direct, hands-on experience with core web technologies like HTTP/HTTPS protocols, network requests, and how to analyze server responses with localthos. This builds a strong understanding of web communications and security headers from the ground up. Second, it creates a controlled environment. Building locally means safe experimentation without impacting live websites. This predictability is ideal for debugging and validating the checker's logic against known setups, ensuring accuracy in its core functions. Lastly, it's cost-effective. \n(Cons)\nHowever, the localhost simulation presents key limitations. The most critical is the lack of real-world accuracy. Scanning from local machine doesn't reflect actual internet conditions like network latency or global server locations. This creates a \"self-claim\" issue, where results aren't truly representative of public websites. Additionally, it leads to limited scope. You can't test against diverse server configurations or simulate scans from different geographical regions, which are vital for a comprehensive web checker. Lastly, there's the perception of \"reinventing the wheel.\" Without a unique approach, the project might appear to simply duplicate features already available in mature tools like Qualys SSL Labs or GTmetrix.\n\nKey Improvements \n\n * Deploy to Public Server: The most impactful step is to host the checker on a low-cost cloud service (e.g., AWS, Vercel) to scan real, public websites. This directly addresses the \"self-claim\" issue \n * Deepen Analysis: Enhance the checks. For SSL/TLS, analyze cipher suites and certificate chains. For HTTP Security Headers, provide granular feedback and assign a security score. For open ports, identify services and explain specific risks.\n * Enhance User Interface: Implement pagination and search for the scan history. Introduce a clear, weighted ranking or score for scan results, providing an instant visual indicator of a website's security posture.\n * Incorporate Risk Analysis: Categorize findings (e.g., High, Medium, Low risk) and, crucially, provide actionable remediation steps \n ",

There is an inconsistent use of font families, and the slides are overly text-heavy, lacking visual aids or illustrations to support understanding. Improving the visual hierarchy and integrating graphics would enhance clarity and engagement.\n\n2. The system interface design requires refinement. For instance, action buttons such as Add, Delete, and Statistical Report are placed too closely together, creating a cluttered appearance. On the list page, the action buttons are misaligned, with \u201cDetails\u201d and \u201cEdit\u201d on top and \u201cDelete\u201d positioned separately at the bottom, thus causing visual imbalance. Additionally, using the same color scheme for both action buttons and table header buttons leads to confusion. A clearer separation in layout and design would improve user experience.\n\n3. There are issues with inconsistent capitalization in dropdown options, and misalignment of label text, which affect the overall polish and professionalism of the interface. Consistency in UI elements plays a key role in user trust and ease of use.\n\n4. The process of entering data into the system is overly complicated and time-consuming. The number of steps required may discourage users from continuing to use the system, especially during initial onboarding.

    "comments": "Your project offers a conceptually strong solution that will greatly improve digital accessibility for older people, which is a very important goal. The modular design, which includes several AI-powered features like issue detection and smart navigation, shows that the problem was thought about carefully. It would be helpful to go into more detail about the technical details of your solution, especially the training and testing methods for your self-trained CNN model and the exact role of your database. This would make your solution even stronger. Also, telling a more coherent story about the whole user journey would make it clearer how all of these new features work together for the end user.\n\nYour idea for UNCLE as an add-on solution is great because it fills a need in a big and growing market. You've also shown that you can think ahead by giving high-level revenue projections and a release schedule. But for UNCLE to be commercially viable, a lot depends on solving real-world design problems. To make sure the solution can handle a lot of users and different types of real-world websites in the future, it's important to come up with a strong plan for scaling it. This plan should include all the technical details of how to integrate it and handle the computational load. A more detailed go-to-market plan with clear customer acquisition channels and a clear pricing model with the assumptions behind it would make your path as an entrepreneur even stronger. If these practical and technical issues are handled well, UNCLE's chances of making money and being adopted by the market will go up a lot.\n\nI have enjoyed your great presentation. The presentation was engaging and clear. It demonstrates your knowledge on the topic and how confident you are in yourself and your project. Keep innovating!",

    "comments": "project demonstrates an impressive solution, the problem statement and scope are not well framed. It is essential to clearly define the specific issue you aim to address and breadth of project's objectives. A well-articulated problem statement and scope not only provide context but also set the foundation for evaluating the relevance and effectiveness of the solution.\nThe solution indeed appears promising, showcasing potential to address the intended problem effectively. However, there is a noticeable lack of detailed information regarding how the solution was achieved. For instance, the specifics of the machine learning model used are not mentioned. It is crucial to include details about the ML model selection, the rationale behind choosing a particular model, and how it was trained and validated. This information is vital for understanding the robustness and reliability of the solution.\nThe architecture and system flow presented appear to be at a high level, lacking in-depth explanations of the components and their interactions. A more detailed architectural description would enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the project. It is important to illustrate how different modules of the system interact, the data flow, and the overall structure that supports the solution. Such detailed documentation helps in evaluating the feasibility and scalability of the system.\nDespite these gaps, the system development and the final solution are satisfactory. The project shows potential and indicates a competent execution of the core idea. However, to transform this project into a fully operational and credible model, it is essential to include detailed workflows and methodologies. A clear depiction of the methodologies used, including data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation processes, would significantly enhance the project's credibility and provide a complete picture of the solution.\nIn conclusion, while the project exhibits promise and technical competence, there is a need for more detailed documentation and clarification of the methodologies and processes involved. By addressing the issues related to the framing of the problem statement and scope, providing detailed information on the ML model used, and elaborating on the system architecture and flow, this project can be elevated to a higher level of excellence. I encourage incorporating these elements to create a more robust and transparent working model.",

The problem is when (in the demo) editing a document, the old content is completely disappear. Imagine if the previous content was like 5-6 paragraphs, and just to make a little adjustment in a specific sentence.\n2. Download document. This is the new potential of breach data. If we could manage to have access to the computer, then we also have access to the file. It is better either the downloaded file is also encrypted, take out the download feature. In health care industry, they sometime only use hardcopy (printable documents) instead a downloadable soft file.\n\n# Minor\n1. Enter file's password.

As such, the practical and entrepreneurial opportunities appear limited unless the project can identify a unique differentiator or solve a current gap in existing solutions (e.g., accessibility, local language support, or integration into national curriculums).\n\nAdditionally, the presentation lacked clarity in system architecture and solution design \u2014 more technical depth on how the recommendation system works, data flow, and scalability considerations would have strengthened the overall quality and seriousness of the solution.\n\nTo improve, the team should focus on:\n\nIdentifying what makes their app stand out from existing ones.\n\nDemonstrating a clear architectural design and deployment model.\n\nExploring potential use cases beyond just time-telling \u2014 perhaps expanding into a broader early math education platform.",

It should be a short term goal to encourage user to save a portion of their income from that point of time onward, instead, the application uses the past incomes and expenses as the base data, does that means it is encouraging the user to spend all of his/her saving once they hit the goal? Also, the progress bar for each record in the budget tracking function is confusing, it is calculated using the income/expense divided by the goal, this information provides no value to the user.\n\n4) The Income management and Expense management function are separated but why are they sharing the bill type drop down?\n\n5) Consider to only include monthly incomes and expenses instead of every data point of the user for State Analysis so user can track improvement on spending habit. Notification could be shown when user is recording expenses instead of only showing when user choose the State Analysis function.\n\nFinancial knowledge sharing module is a great addition in a personal financial management system.",

    "comments": "The project introduces ReGazeVR, a virtual reality-based rehabilitation game intended to support stroke patients experiencing eye-tracking difficulties. The concept is to deliver clinically inspired visual exercises in an engaging 3D environment using gaze-based interaction. It claims to support home-based therapy with real-time tracking, progress monitoring via Firebase, and remote therapist supervision\u2014all of which are promising in terms of accessibility and scalability, particularly for rural or mobility-limited users.\n\nHowever, after watching the presentation, it was difficult to determine the actual progress of the development. Much of the video seemed to rely on general internet content rather than showing concrete implementation or original development work. Key aspects like demo walkthroughs, interface design, or user testing were missing or unclear. This raises questions about whether the team has a working prototype or if the project remains mostly at a conceptual level.\n\nIn addition, the idea itself is not entirely novel. Similar VR rehabilitation tools for visual and motor therapy already exist, and even the GitHub link https://github.com/DidStuffStudio/ReGaze/tree/main seems closely related or possibly reused. This affects the originality of the work, unless the team can clearly demonstrate what new contributions they have made beyond existing solutions.\n\nOverall, while the problem being addressed is meaningful and the proposed approach aligns with current trends in digital health, the project lacks clarity on implementation and differentiation. For future presentations, it would help to show hands-on development, specific technical contributions, and how this version improves or builds upon existing work.",

The avatar (eg: Teacher Isma) can be at the top corner, small logo will do.\n\nOverall, I can see that you have put a lot of efforts in designing the UI. It is colorful, and full of beautiful design and creature. I am sure children will like it! Good job. \n\n",

    "comments": "Real-Route is a real-time route optimization system that aims to alleviate urban congestion and improve mobility using Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication and adaptive route optimization algorithms. Unlike typical navigation apps that rely heavily on crowdsourced data, Real-Route utilizes direct inputs from roadside units (RSUs) and connected vehicles, enabling more accurate and timely traffic predictions. The system includes both a mobile application for drivers and a dashboard for traffic managers, allowing multi-level interaction\u2014from individual guidance to city-wide mobility oversight.\n\nThe system is well-conceived, aligning with smart city, sustainability, and Industry 4.0 trends. The dual-interface approach (public + operator) is commendable and demonstrates foresight for real-world applications across logistics, urban commuting, and even autonomous systems. The claim of scalability and flexibility is theoretically sound.\n\nHowever, despite the strong vision, the innovative execution is limited at the FYP level. V2X infrastructure is still sparse in most regions, and there\u2019s no indication that this project is integrated with actual RSUs or live vehicle feeds. Instead, it appears to rely on simulated or static data, which limits the real-time intelligence it claims to deliver. The adaptive routing algorithm is not described in detail, raising questions about whether it\u2019s genuinely novel or just a variation of shortest-path techniques.\n\nIn summary, Real-Route presents a well-framed concept, but the actual implementation falls short of the real-world complexity and innovation it aims to represent.",

Additionally, the measurement of distance to the university in meters should be changed to kilometers.

There are several areas where further clarification and technical depth would improve your approach.\n\nWhile the tool appears to automatically prioritize alerts, the methodology behind this prioritization is not clearly defined. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the logic or algorithmic criteria being used \u2014 for example, are you weighing CVSS scores, exploitability metrics, or contextual relevance to the client\u2019s environment?\n\nThe source and scope of your vulnerability detection are somewhat ambiguous. Are you leveraging public vulnerability databases such as CVE.org or the NVD (National Vulnerability Database), and if so, how are you integrating that data into your scanning logic? \n\nIt would be helpful to allow this to be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline. A seamless integration with development workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) could significantly improve developer responsiveness and encourage secure coding practices.",

A quick market check suggests there are no existing apps offering a similar solution specifically for Malaysia, which adds relevance to the work. However, the solution appears to require significant manual effort from clinic administrators; more automation could have been integrated to improve operational efficiency. From an innovation standpoint, the project lacks a strong \"wow\" factor. For example, instead of pet owners turning to apps like ChatGPT for symptom inquiries, the app could position itself as the first point of contact \u2014 capturing early symptom information and passing useful insights to the attending veterinarian. Integrating AI in this way would add value and differentiate the product further.",

Simplify certain steps, such as the attendance page. Teachers should not have to click on each student icon to check in. Instead, list all student names with buttons for \"present,\" \"late,\" \"absent,\" and \"dismissed\" beside each name. Teachers would only need to click the appropriate button once or select certain buttons for absent students.\n3. The pitching feels a bit rushed.\n4.

The core concept for predicting at-risk students is valuable. For enhanced practicality, the demo should elaborate on how course completion data is generated and tracked. Currently, it's frontend-centric; showcasing backend operations and data processing is essential. Crucially, detailing integration strategies with existing LMS platforms and robustly tracking engagement with external learning resources (documents, media) would significantly broaden its applicability and improve comprehensive student support. Addressing these points will elevate the project's impact.",

One of the example is that Recommend do provide some insurance up to certain amount if the service providers broke something during the service.\n\nThis should be an APP for accessibility and mobility.\n\nGood job great work, I believe this is production ready.",

    "comments": "1. AI Recipe Generator (Cuisine Culture)\nIngredient Challenges: Some users may find it challenging to understand recipes based solely on ingredients. Enhancing this with information about the type of cuisine by culture  can improve user experience,\n\nSentiment Analysis: Analyzing sentiment from comments can be subjective. Using star ratings initially is a good approach. Eventually, integrating sentiment analysis into generative recipes could be considered, keeping in mind the complexities of subjective opinions.\n\nHomepage and Logo: Improving the homepage with a logo that has a transparent background can enhance visual appeal and professionalism.\n\nDetailed Instructions: Implementing an auto-scroll view for detailed instructions can ensure users can easily read long, static content without truncation.\n\n2. Product with Multiple Algorithms \nNutritional Analysis: Using algorithms like Euclidean distance for nutritional analysis is useful but needs to consider factors beyond just weight and height. Factors like Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), medical conditions, and dietary restrictions should also be incorporated for accurate results.\n\nUser Interface: Implementing scroll views or frame layouts for detailed pictures can improve user interaction, allowing users to explore content without missing any details.\n\nTechnical Implementation: Utilizing resources like the example on Stack Overflow for resizing ImageView within ScrollView can enhance the technical aspects of the product.\n\nUser Engagement: Ensuring users can seamlessly explore detailed content they scroll through is crucial for user satisfaction and engagement.\n\n3. Overall Application\nOverall, your ideas indicate a strong focus on improving user experience, integrating advanced features like sentiment analysis gradually, and ensuring nutritional and health-related functionalities are robust and accurate. Continuous improvement based on user feedback and technological advancements will certainly make your application valuable and useful to a broader audience interested in fitness and health.\n\nIf you need further detailed advice on any specific aspect or want to delve deeper into implementation strategies, feel free to ask!",

    "comments": "NutriSense is a great example of a well innovative and technology driven product in the digital nutrition and health category. Its application of deep learning for instant recognition of fruits and vegetables to address the issue of manual input, a significant issue in food logging, increases the users' convenience significantly. \n\nThe tiered process of not just recognizing food, but also enriching it with personalized dietary guidance based on the health of the individual makes the app both intelligent and creating health awareness. The simplicity of use of the dashboard UI further enhances functionality by allowing users to view nutritional data and track progress in an easily digestible format, which is integral for long-term adherence and compliance with diet goals.\n\nI would like to suggest some improvements such as you might add analysis of meal makeup  and such as meal breakdown and OCR capabilities to translate food packaging. Adding integration with wearables or electronic health records  might allow for more condition conscious, dynamic suggestions, too.\n\nI believe NutriSense presents a great blend of AI, personalization, and user centric design, and it is a highly appealing solution for active nutrition and healthcare management.",

    "comments": "Your project is feature-rich and has the potential to become a significant player in this niche market. With a clear focus and a reliable, powerful development team, you can further enhance and market this project successfully. Here are some considerations for your project's roadmap:\n1. Project Scaling\n- Suggestion: Given the diverse features (chatbot, pricing and info, mechanic locator, discussion forum), consider separating each feature into independent services.\n- Benefit: Adopting a microservices architecture allows each feature to scale independently and be maintained more efficiently. For example, use MongoDB to store chatbot interaction history, ElasticSearch for storing pricing and information, and PostgreSQL for the discussion forum. This separation ensures better performance and scalability.\n\n2. Reliable Web Framework:\n- Suggestion: Utilize a robust web framework capable of handling high traffic and ensuring reliability in a production environment.\n- Benefit: Frameworks like Laravel (PHP), Fiber/Echo/Gin (Go), or Django (Python) are known for their reliability and performance in production settings. Choosing a proven framework can help manage large-scale applications effectively.\n\n3. Production-Ready Configuration:\n- Suggestion: Avoid using default configurations when preparing for production deployment.\n- Benefit: Default configurations are typically suited for development environments and may not provide the necessary security and performance optimizations required for production. Ensure you configure your application for security, performance, and scalability specific to production needs.\n\n4. Log Metrics:\n- Suggestion: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring metrics.\n- Benefit: Logging metrics are crucial for identifying issues, monitoring performance, and ensuring the smooth operation of your application in a production environment. Tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, and Grafana can help in collecting and visualizing these metrics effectively.\n\nBy following these recommendations, you can ensure that your project is well-prepared for growth, maintains high performance, and is ready for market deployment. Excellent work on your project so far, and I look forward to seeing its future success!",

Your slides were often very wordy, in business we usually use much fewer words on the slide and then talk through the points.\n\nIt was clever to have the avatar of the user on the left while demonstrating the user interface. It was a very simple and effective way to make it very clear what role you were demonstrating.\n\nThe user interface looks good.  You didn't talk about the technologies you used.\n\nIt was very clever to gamify regular logins and to reward progress with tutor sessions. You didn't discuss the financial model behind this and I wondered if the cost of having human admins to assess the goals and the cost of paying the tutors would be recouped by the subscription fees.\n\n",

However, I think the solution could add value if it could be able to take a complex problem, and break it down into multiple chunks, and recommend experts from diverse backgrounds that could help contribute to the topic. Based on the demo, it seems to only be recommend based on similarity, and may not be that useful as I imagine it will end up reccommending a group of people with all similar expertises, which more not be useful for cross-pollination of ideas and innovation.",

You could have mentioned how you encrypt the personal details in the database. For example, if your database is leaked then the identity of the student and the places they regularly travel would be available. This could compromise their physical safety, so I think you should pay attention to data security.",

Building an in-app community\u2014similar to Facebook\u2014can encourage relationships and peer support, which may further help users improve their mental well-being.\n3.

The use of your \"reaction pic\" in the thumbnail is an effective way to pique user interest and is used a lot by influencers - well done for including it.\n\nI think that your choice of tech was good.  Your presentation missed the opportunity to highlight the positive aspects of using it. For example, you will be able to deploy to iOS and Android using the same codebase which reduces the cost of development and maintenance.\n\nDid you consider using Redis to manage the leaderboard? It has a very simple mechanism that lets you do this with minimal effort.\n\nYour architecture diagram makes it look like you're connecting the application directly to the database. Where would you implement load balancing and caches?\n\nHow about using AI to detect if an image is inappropriate when a user uploads it? It would be better to have some sort of pre-screening in place to prevent bad actors from uploading bad images.  If you wait for a report then you need to hire moderators and also the post will be visible to users for a while. This has an impact on UX (seeing bad images) and entrepreneurship (salary costs) that I think you could have discussed.\n\nYou did not mention security and privacy. I think you should protect your users and at least mention that you've considered these issues.",

One comment, student mentioned abotu social media promotion of event in problem statement, but student do not talk about GTM strategy, how to get you first customer, you can have a great product but GTM is equally important. It will be great if student managed to build a social media login for the applicaiton, and a mobile apps to store and flash the QR code. That complete the solution. Overall great job!",

Including a comparison between the two styles would help illustrate the innovative aspects of your application more clearly.\n- This project has potential for extension, such as adding and integrating image-based (pie charts, graphs, tables) narration besides text-based. \n- Looking forward to hear more on different narration tone and syles that the app offers (instead of just language change), but the demo wrapped up a bit early.\n\nThis is a solid effort that shows dedication and hard work. Well done.",

    "comments": "EchoMind is a comprehensive virtual mental health platform developed to support university students in managing their emotional well-being. It combines a range of features\u2014including real-time emotion detection via facial recognition, a 24/7 Mental Health Virtual Assistant (MHVA) chatbot, a counseling booking system, and curated self-help resources such as guided meditation, music, and articles. The project presents itself as a holistic and inclusive mental health ecosystem designed to reduce stigma and promote accessible mental wellness support.\n\nThe project demonstrates strong social relevance and commendable intent. Mental health is a pressing concern among students, and EchoMind addresses this with empathy and thoughtful design. The inclusion of emotion detection technology adds a layer of personalization, while the MHVA chatbot extends the app\u2019s utility beyond office hours, making it potentially more approachable than traditional support systems.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the combination of facial recognition and chatbot functionality presents moderate complexity. However, it\u2019s important to note that these technologies are not novel on their own; their value lies in thoughtful integration and ethical application. The project would be strengthened by clear validation of the emotion detection\u2019s accuracy, privacy safeguards for sensitive data, and actual user feedback to assess usability and trust.\n\nOverall, EchoMind is a well-scoped, meaningful solution with strong potential for real-world use. It balances usability, empathy, and technology effectively, though innovation largely stems from integration rather than novel development.",

Specifically, the distinction between default and custom models requires elucidation. How will doctors access or curate a custom dataset for training? Addressing this critical data requirement is paramount. Furthermore, the decision to employ multiple models rather than a unified approach warrants clarification. While innovation is laudable, practicality must not be overlooked. A more explicit articulation of the project\u2019s purpose would enhance overall coherence and engagement. Balancing novelty with feasibility is crucial for success",

    "comments": "I think that this solution is needed in current time and era. The existing chatbot technologies are very modest and poor in providing the most desired results for a business, that is Customer Engagement. This should be the main keyword of the Problem statement, and I didn't see it in the presentation. I think Muhammad has to rethink the problem statement delivery, in order to really address the problems that real world users need to be solved. Then, the solution has to be tied in strongly to customer engagement and successful sales. \n\nI think there is still plenty of room for Innovativeness, such as the use of AI to generate data set within the backend of the dashboard, features like drag and drop logic for questions and answers for the chatbot, libraries of questions and answers, personalization of the human voice to target specific customers based on age, geographical location, occupation, language, lifestyle, etc. \n\nAs for the presentation structure, it should consist of a little bit of yourself and anything that ties you to the problem to show your expertise or experience, then pains that are being solved which in this case is actually Customer Engagement to lead to purchases, then show some current conditions and some real figures to show the demand to this solution, then finally the Go to market plan and show how it can be successful with some projection sales figures. \n\nRemember to also EMPHASIZE the benefits that the chatbot users will get, the business owners. Free package should include all features but with limitations.\n\nThe presenter's emotion and excitement, can really do good to what you are presenting. And finally, I think this is one of the most needed solutions to be presented out there now, as we enter the AI-dominated world.\n",

This clear problem definition establishes an excellent foundation. The engineered solution, which uses Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), is conceptually strong, with a well-designed modular architecture and intelligent components such as SetFit and Gemini. However, more information on ABSA model training data, its applicability to various types of products, and your specific ABSA implementation is required. Practically, the design is unclear regarding scaling for large user bases or e-commerce integration. I recommend providing these explicit details and incorporating scalability into your design.\n\nYour solution stands out for its innovativeness, providing granular, aspect-specific insights through SetFit ABSA and Gemini integration, as well as its continuous learning mechanism. This has significant implications for consumers and businesses. To make these more compelling, quantify potential gains such as time savings or increased conversion rates.\n\nYour pitch was exceptionally well-structured and clear, with a smooth live demonstration. However, the background music was excessively loud, interfering with your verbal delivery. For future pitches, make sure the audio levels are optimal to enhance your delivery.\n\nYour entrepreneurial vision is admirable, with innovative monetization strategies such as the browser extension and API platform that are perfectly aligned with market opportunities. To strengthen this, create a more detailed go-to-market strategy that includes acquisition tactics and a comprehensive pricing model.\n\nOverall, your dedication is evident, and SELEK has good potential and real-world impact.

The problem statement is clear, and the solution is practical, leveraging a 3-tier architecture with Node.js and MySQL. However, the innovation score is moderate, as gamified trading platforms are not entirely novel. The impact on financial literacy is notable, though quantifiable metrics are missing. Practicality is decent, with core modules like login, trading, and leaderboards implemented, but scalability and user retention challenges are unaddressed. Entrepreneurial potential exists but lacks a defined business model. Overall, it\u2019s a solid educational tool with room for refinement in uniqueness and commercialisation. ",

The story of \"Uncle Rashid\" does a great job of showing how hard it is for older people to keep track of all their medications. DrugMate's modular design and the use\u00a0of an LLM with OCR capabilities are approperiate\u00a0for solving such a difficult problem. To make the solution more technically sound, it is important to provide a detailed explanation\u00a0of how you fine-tuned or prompt the\u00a0Gemini Flash model and, most importantly, to describe a\u00a0method for checking the accuracy and reliability of its medical outputs. You should also justify why you chose to use Gemini and MongoDB instead of other options.\u00a0\n\nThe OCR-assisted drug interaction checker is a good idea, but its unique selling point needs to be made clearer. Think about demonstrating how DrugMate's implementation is more accurate, reliable, or easy to use with certified medical databases than a free general-purpose LLM. Additionally, for the solution to be ready for real-world use, it needs to handle concerns about regulatory compliance, data privacy, and scalability to a large number of users.\n\nYour well-structured business model demonstrates your innovative approach to entering the market. However, the entrepreneurial opportunity is notably constrained by the absence of a truly defensible unique selling point against free LLMs and, more critically, by the unaddressed practical and regulatory challenges. To make DrugMate a useful and commercially viable solution in the healthcare field, it will be important to successfully address these key technical and operational issues.\n\nYour dedication to this vital area is clearly demonstrated, and your passion for addressing medication safety challenges is commendable. I strongly encourage you to continue developing your innovative solution.",

It's a basic features, no one cares about Login, we should only focus on the main features of this project.\n\nThe website itself seems not enough user friendly, the presenter has to explain some parts via the demo (e.g., the meaning of colors of recommended spots).\n\nI liked the part where there are also suggestion of other sites near the travel spot, based on the user's history of travel places.\nHowever, for recommendation based on the other users ratings, I'm wondering how to maintain a reviews/ratings data base; why users would rate/review spots in this tool, while they are already doing it in websites like Google/TripAdvisor.\nI would prefer to focus on the recommendation engine, rather than in the ratings/reviews (by getting these ones from external partners).\n\nI don't see the real advantage of the chatbot, (need to ask the weather for every city one by one). Why not directly give the weather of locations when planning the trip?",

You can claim that this app has the potential to record all activities and the voting feature is an added advantage.\n\nFeedback:\n\nImprove your presentation audio quality.\nFor a subscription-based model, you need to do extensive research to monetize the app effectively.\nCheck out an app called Splitwise for additional ideas that could enhance your app.\nKeep up the great work!",

While it presents a lot of information, it would be nice if this is further enhanced to be able to recommend a buy or no buy, real or fake product, sorted list of best value for money, etc. Also, consumers might not be willing to pay for this unless this could be expanded to have more features. It also has limitation which is that it depends on the number of reviews of the product (the more reviews the higher the sampling rate which improves the accuracy), so the real problem for most users is that the product has very little to no review that it is hard to make the judgement to buy. For products with many reviews, generally by scrolling down and seeing some consistent positive reviews that has long detailed writings would help nudge buyers to buy or vice versa, seeing some consistent negative reviews would help buyers to avoid it. But great idea and definitely an impactful one.",

Although the proposed solution is not entirely novel\u2014similar approaches have been observed in Europe\u2014it is still highly practical and relevant when applied in the context of Penang and Malaysia, where such solutions are less prevalent.

On the temperature sensing and local device control shown in the demo, these may not be too critical since such sensors are already available in those devices (heating and cooling), but they may help to supplement built-in sensors for more accurate responses. I would also suggest to include a bit of details on how data is stored and analyzed in AWS (which database service, which compute platform, etc.) in addition to the focus on MQTT and IoT Core. In conclusion though, a good demonstration of integrating microcontrollers, different languages, and Cloud technologies.",

Nevertheless, here are my suggestions for you to improve your project, some of which you might have done already :-\n\n1. Verify the performance and stability of your tool. E.g. any corner cases or areas in the UI that cause odd state ?\n2. How do you keep the database up-to-date all the time ? How comprehensive is the data base ? \n3. Ensure that comprehensive and automated tests are done.\n4. Get feedback from real users.

As far as I could see, this critical component wasn\u2019t mentioned, so it\u2019s difficult to assess how the feature would operate in a real-world setting.\n\nAdditionally, any system handling real money is likely subject to regulatory and licensing requirements, which are important considerations in the planning and design stage.

However, currently the solution hasn't fully meet the potential as the main value of the automation is to drive a drop in test time reduction, automate running the bulk of the tests, test result management and more. You can also show the impact of your tool by showing the real work results such as % test time reduction or statistics of how long these tests usually take the developer.  To be clear, you don't have to broadly solve all use-cases out there. It is sufficient pick a few common use cases and make a large enough improvement to those (e.g. smaller set of user base, but if the value is there, users will adopt the tools).\n\nKeep up the great work and thank you for your presentation !",

Include review that has mixed language (as you mentioned in your problem statement, Bahasa Rojak).\nFor \"collect code-mixed product reviews from websites\", yes, you took Lazada as example.\nFor \"determine and implement optimal model for classifying sentiment accurately\", no proper example show to compare, and how to choose which model is suitable, and why.\nFor \"user-friendly sentiment analytics dashboard\", yes, you have bar chart and trend chart, and data can be export to csv file, very comprehensive.\n\nImpacts & Benefits\nWill assist online business owners by providing accurate sentiment analysis.\n\nPracticality\nCurrent design requires users to manually copy and paste links or upload CSV files for analysis, would suggest automating the process to reflect real-time data to business owners.\n\nContent and Clarity\nPresentation slides are clear and easy to understand.\nConsistent design and theme, with animations and transitions between slides. It is fluent.\nRecommends using easy-to-read fonts like Calibri, Arial, and Gill Sans.\nAdvises ensuring screenshot font sizes match body content font sizes for readability, or rebuilding content in PowerPoint if font is too small.\n\nPresentation Skills\nPresenter has good attire and outlook, with welcoming facial expressions and gestures.\nAdvises avoiding the use of \"so\" at the beginning of every sentence.",

Without insight into the tech stack or infrastructure, it\u2019s difficult to assess whether the proposed monthly subscription fee is justifiable. From my perspective, the pricing seems too steep for widespread adoption in educational institutions, especially considering existing budget constraints.\n\nAs a software engineer, I\u2019d also recommend rethinking the delivery model. Rather than releasing this as a standalone app, it might be more strategic to develop it as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution. This would allow the core attendance-tracking feature to be integrated into platforms that institutions are already using, avoiding redundancy and improving scalability. Positioning it as a feature that complements existing systems\u2014rather than replicating them\u2014could make the offering more attractive and sustainable.",

Owner might not be able to get phone number/emails from the customer during payment. \n- QR code scanner - Faster checkout for customer to process order\n- Promo code should be entered by customer. \n- Standalone module for analysis - It will be interesting to see how existing POS system's data to work with the algorithm and review the forecasting.\n- Capability to import data using CSV files. \n\nOverall, this is a very comprehensive system that consider different aspect to run business.

The good part is that the solution present is sensible, using a robot to deliver is a good idea but the solution or method using wasn't new as that have been using in the food stall to deliver food from stall to your table. The solution also wasn't include any moving object obstacle avoidance(at least not in the presentation). It is dangerous if it hit any patient. I believe there are more to done before it can go to entrepreneurship such as go through multiple floor to deliver medicine and so on.",

Avoid negative implications in your brand name\n\n2) Reconsider the positioning of the solution - mental health issues are a complex and vast area - a solution that positions itself to tackle this may prove infeasible. Consider repositioning as a 'Life Coach' - helping users to achieve their peak performance in studying, working, and achieving their goals. Elements of mental/emotional state can still be covered as something complementary \n\n3) While the potential for GenAI to help with providing a natural supportive interactive tool remains huge, there are concerns around limiting users' interaction with other humans further (a very real issue in mental health challenges) - consider having the tool encourage users to set up a call list of friends and family so that chatbot can consistently encourage users to reach out and talk to others. Prompt with 'when was the last time you had an encouraging conversation with ....\". \n\n4) There are also concerns around GenAI tools feeding into the fears and conspiracy thinking of some users - some behaviors of these LLM models cannot be adequately predicted for user safety, especially those with mental health challenges. \n",

    "comments": "\nThis project presents a commendable initiative to convert unstructured, real-time web data into structured insights for disaster response. The integration of web scraping, rule-based NLP, and a React Native mobile interface demonstrates a good understanding of cross-technology workflows. The classification of messages into Emergency, Alert, and Non-Emergency categories offers a foundational layer for prioritization, and the JSON-structured output is appropriate for downstream usage and API exposure.\n\nHowever, reliance on external web sources such as NADMA, Buletin Mutiara, and JPS raises concerns about data reliability, format inconsistency, and long-term scalability. Web scraping is fragile\u2014subject to layout changes, network latency, and legal issues. As the project scales nationwide, latency and server load will increase. Therefore, the system must adopt a hybrid architecture: scrape + ingest authoritative APIs (where possible), store the data in a NoSQL or time-series database, and use asynchronous queue-based systems (e.g., RabbitMQ or Pub/Sub) with caching (e.g., Redis) for real-time response. An architecture diagram is essential to communicate this flow.\n\nThe use of OCR (e.g., Tesseract) is a smart inclusion, but its application needs clearer demonstration. OCR alone is not enough\u2014optical data should pass through a pre-trained lightweight LLM (e.g., DistilBERT) for better context extraction (hazard type, location, urgency). You may also integrate image classification models (e.g., MobileNet or EfficientNet) to detect floods or fires directly from social media images. These AI layers enhance both precision and automation.\n\nUI/UX requires refinement\u2014spacing, alignment, color consistency, and control types (e.g., using dropdowns instead of text boxes) should follow Material Design principles. Tools like Figma can guide design consistency.\n\nLastly, focus on specific hazards (e.g., floods or wildfires) for Phase 1 deployment, enabling structured adoption before expanding scope.\n\n\n",

What if you have multiple different companies using your product?  It's also not clear to me what consideration has been given to user privacy and security. \n\nI also wondered why you decided to use Supabase and not Firestore. There are advantages to reducing the number of suppliers in your infrastructure - centralised control and billing, for example. I didn't catch anything in the presentation to justify using an entirely different provider for something that is already present in Google cloud.\n\nI don't see any technical details around reliability. How are messages passed around the system? How is this monitored from a technical perspective?  Large companies will want to know that the solution they are buying is reliable and fault tolerant.",

    "comments": "It would improve usability if every primary key in the grid linked to a detail view, e.g., F0001 *+(with hyperlink for detailed popup), as it's hard to recall who/what F0001/INV0001 represents.\n\nImplementing role-based access control (RBAC) is essential. It clarifies who manages what\u2014like controlling inventory\u2014or assigning new users to system roles. Currently, anyone can edit data without accountability.\n\nI'm unsure how ALNS functions here\u2014for instance, how it assigns allocations. If it uses an algorithm, clarify its variables and outcomes per use case. Adaptability suggests adjusting based on stock and requirements, which needs clearer explanation in the presentation deck (so far is blackbox)\n\nSimplify the user interface, especially for managing inventory and allocations on separate pages(or popup) Current UI complexity may confuse less tech-savvy users.\n\nEnsure consistency in allocation rules. Monthly household income influencing allocations should be clearly communicated. Prevent unintended edits during sessions, maintaining system integrity.\n\nEnforce atomicity\u2014no deletions, only soft deletes. Utilize expired item alerts effectively, possibly enhancing with nightly email reminders/reports.\n\nInventory adjustments need constraints on who can modify and how\u2014consider storage implications. Why are new allocations detached from storage? Clarify allocation logic\u2014by stock, user behavior, or household income? Current clarity is lacking.\n\nOverall, streamline UX for non-technical users. Primary keys like product no., family no., and inventory no. should link to detailed pop-ups. Ensure system updates comprehensive packing in storage management. Consider meaningful names for package.family.allocation keys, expanding beyond three primary keys in one page(big no no ). Implement pagination and date search for inventory and package history for improved functionality would be sufficient to help user track the log.\n\nFrom a technological standpoint, I find everything to be satisfactory and professionally executed. However, my current concern a niche market that may find some aspects overly sophisticated. While having advanced algorithms is advantageous, I would appreciate a clearer explanation or a layman's terms description in the product guide detailing when dairy nutritional scenarios would be implemented. This clarification would greatly assist in understanding its practical application within this specialized field.",

EventConnect is a promising idea, especially given the growing need for streamlined tech event discovery and networking opportunities. Your efforts are appreciated, and I wish you continued success in your journey!\n\nHere are some suggestions to enhance your work:\n\nPresentation Clarity:\nConsider reducing less relevant content during your presentation and focus more on the core features and value of your product. Deliver key points clearly and slowly, ensuring your audience can follow and fully grasp your message.\n\nModern Enhancements:\nModern platforms benefit greatly from AI integration. I recommend exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to suggest relevant events to users based on their interests or professional profiles.\n\nCompetitor Comparison:\nWhen referencing existing tools like Meetup, ensure your message is objective, clear, and constructive. Rather than simply calling them disappointing, highlight their limitations and show how EventConnect provides a better user experience.\n\nAccessibility Standards:\nA great product should be usable by all. Please explore the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) by W3C to make your platform more inclusive: W3C WCAG Guidelines\n\nOverall, you\u2019ve laid a strong foundation for an impactful platform. With continued improvements in delivery, technical implementation, and user-centric design, EventConnect can grow into a truly valuable tool for the tech community.\n\nKeep up the great work and continue exploring innovative ideas!\n\nBest regards,\nThiru",

The interface design supports user engagement and reflects a thoughtful understanding of usability principles. I like the idea of tracking users progress and certification after they have completed the awareness courses to motivate them.\n\nOne potential area for enhancement is the addition of a reminder frequency feature. Incorporating customizable reminder intervals would increase the utility of the application, particularly for users managing who haven't completed the task or left the task in the middle of their progress. This would further align the platform with user needs and broaden its functional scope.\n\nOverall, this is a well-executed project with solid design choices and strong potential for continued development.",

Practicing a smoother, more confident pitch would enhance the overall impression.\nRegarding implementation, one challenge is expecting users to manually scan every grocery item \u2014 this might reduce long-term usability. Exploring easier data entry methods, such as receipt scanning, store integration, or automated import of purchases, would greatly improve user adoption and practicality.\nWith these improvements \u2014 especially on simplifying data input and differentiating your solution \u2014 the project could grow into a more competitive and impactful product.",

Key advice is to get to the product demo as soon as you can without spending too much time on the implementation details. Keep the details to later after you have captured the viewer's attention. This is because the slides before the product demo are filled with words which is very difficult for the human to process in such a short amount of time. We are unable to build a mental model/view of how the solution would look like, thus we are unable to linked the functionality of the product towards the points that was mentioned earlier.\n\nI think the solution can be easily replicated without a need for a website thus, it might not have huge entrepreneurial opportunity.

However, the demo could have been more effective with on-screen labels or short captions to help the audience understand what is happening at each step. A key concern is the high number of manual steps throughout the process. Requiring user validation at every stage slows down operations and increases the risk of delays. Introducing automation or smart process handling would greatly improve efficiency and user experience. With improvements, this project could grow into a practical and market-ready solution.",

The translated text for Japanese looks quite short with just hiragana, so I am not sure if there is an issue with Japanese translation. The translated audio is also just played for about 3 seconds so it is too short to make out if all the slides are translated well into Japanese. \n2. English, Chinese and Japanese as the only 3 languages that are shown and that seems to be an odd choice. Why Japanese? I would expect BM to also be included. Maybe this is just the start, and more languages are to be added.\n3. The presentation ended abruptly after the demo; I think it would be good to have some closing statement and also some talking points on what existing plans are there to enhance the app.  ",

When doing any data tracker system, scheduler and alerts play an important part in reminding human being. The Reminder and Alert Module needs to enhance a bit, for example, to add frequency or customisable alert notification. I do like the adaptation of Agile Methodology, International Expansion and Subscription Model. As for technology stack, very good, as its using Flutter.

From a business point of view, this project has real potential for smaller tech events, and developer meetups. But with further development, this could grow into more successful product. One area to improve is community engagement. Right now, the platform does not seem to have a feature like a social feed where users can post updates, share highlights, or interact outside of the events.

The smart system you made shows that you carefully planned your approach and have a good understanding of how to use machine learning to analyze attention. To get a full picture, you need to highlight what hardware is used to collect the data, what database is used to store data, and how. You mentioned that your solution leads to more engagement or a better curriculum, but it's not clear how it provides these values.\n\nYour accessible web-based app is good from a practical point of view. But the current design doesn't have a clear design of how your solution can scale or deal with real-world issues like student privacy and the environment in the classroom. The dashboard's visual insights could also be more intuitive and directly actionable for teachers by providing clear insight and recommendations to improve student engagement in classrooms.\n\nIn your pitch, you clearly explained the problem and the technical parts of the solution. For better communication, try to give equal weight to all parts of the system, such as the hardware and the data flow. You could also improve your presentation skills to keep people's attention and interest.\n\nLastly, you have done a great job by suggesting ways to commercialize your solution. For improvement, you should come up with a strategy to release your solution to the market that includes a thorough analysis of the market and your competitors.\n\nYour project has a lot of potential.

    "comments": "Definitely one of the best project demos that I watched. From describing the problem, proposing the solution, and overall demo is very informative. The Q&A towards the end also gives a nice touch to cover potential questions. Overall, the presenter did a very good job and there is a great potential for the product. \n \nA few nice to have: \n\nFor large scale businesses where they have inventory systems in place already, it would be good to have APIs readily available to have ease of migration for existing data to this new platform. This will give convenience to onboarding new businesses and integrating with any existing systems seamless.\n\nAuditing is one important aspect in the real world- how much was sold vs how much inventory expired and we were not able to sell. Those are nice to have information and report to surface to allow business owners to make informed decision whether to stock up a specific product or something is not selling well to the consumers. \n\nThis project is outstanding, so well done to the presenter! software engineering opens the possibilities of improving our way of life. At the same time, having the opportunity to create something sustainable and will have long term benefits! Kudos!\n",

    "comments": "Understanding:\nThis project presents a web-based academic prediction system aimed at supporting educators by identifying students at risk of underperforming or dropping out. It uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically an MLP model, to analyze various student metrics such as grades, attendance, and preparation hours. The tool is aligned with SDG 4 goals and promotes timely intervention, with a user-friendly interface suitable for non-technical users.\n\nVerdict:\nThe presentation was clear and well-delivered. The idea itself is both meaningful and practical, offering real value to educational institutions that are increasingly seeking data-driven insights to improve student outcomes and retention.\n\nHowever, upon deeper reflection, there are some important concerns. The implementation details were not discussed in depth, particularly around data size and quality\u2014critical factors in the success of any deep learning model. Predicting academic performance accurately involves a wide range of variables, including institutional context, learning environment, and sometimes even social or psychological background. These are difficult to capture in a single dataset, and deep learning methods like MLPs typically require large volumes of diverse data to produce reliable predictions.\n\nThe presenter did not address these challenges, such as how the model would be trained for deployment in different institutions or how domain-specific data would be collected and adapted. Without these considerations, the feasibility and scalability of the solution remain uncertain.\n\nOverall, this is a well-thought-out project with a promising goal, but its long-term viability depends heavily on how it addresses data availability, model adaptability, and ethical handling of student information.\nLastly the presentation was a bit long.  Could have delivered the message within 10 min.",

Some parts were clearly explained while some are glossed over. A more structured approach to the presentation would benefit the pitch. Would love to see a higher level of enthusiasm too.\n\nGiven the simplistic nature of the project, the potential for widespread use is definitely there but not in its current state as only 1 of the games in the system has a clear goal. The others were not as clear and may not come across as beneficial for the user who is playing it. \n\nFor a system/game aimed for children, there are lots of terms used that may not be within the lingo of the target audience. There were many long descriptive texts which do explain of the different SDGs and the system's goals, but would be too much for the target audience.\n\nThe UI however, is clearly made to cater for children and is a positive, though navigating through the UI is may be challenging for first time users.",

Leveraging IoT and LoRaWAN for disaster monitoring is a practical approach, particularly for areas with limited connectivity. However, several of the key features mentioned\u2014such as flood, landslide, haze, and fire detection\u2014were not clearly demonstrated in the video. This makes it difficult to fully evaluate the depth and completeness of the solution. Additionally, there appears to be some editing in the video, which raises a bit of doubt about whether certain functionalities were shown in real-time or simulated. As such, the presentation may not fully reflect the actual implementation, which could affect how the solutioning is assessed. A more transparent and comprehensive demonstration would greatly strengthen the credibility and overall impact of the project.\n\n",

    "comments": "Stockastic is a web-based solution designed to help Malaysian SMEs manage inventory, forecast raw material prices, and monitor profits. It includes four core modules\u2014Inventory Management, Price Forecasting, Profit Tracking, and User Management\u2014with forecasting models such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, and XGBoost to predict price trends and support business planning.\n\nThe project is well-organized and meets a clear business need. It demonstrates competent use of data science tools, system design, and web development frameworks. The modular approach ensures that the platform is practical for SME users and aligns with digitalization goals. Its strength lies in integrating commonly used business features into a single platform tailored to a local context.\n\nHowever, the solution overall is not innovative or novel. Inventory and profit management systems are well-established, and many commercially available platforms already offer similar or more advanced features. The forecasting component uses standard models without new techniques, optimization strategies, or industry-specific tuning. There is no unique algorithmic contribution, predictive insight beyond baseline models, or automation logic that distinguishes it from typical SME software tools.\n\nThe dashboard could benefit from real-time data integration, supply chain analytics, smart reorder suggestions, or more advanced pricing strategies. As it stands, the system reflects a solid academic implementation of existing ideas, rather than a breakthrough solution.",

While the current scope is limited to appointment bookings, there are potential opportunities to expand into online counseling services. However, the project lacks critical financial metrics such as the cost to acquire both customers and therapists, which could impact its overall evaluation.\n\nStrengths\nStrong Security Measures: The project emphasizes robust security protocols, which is essential for protecting sensitive user data. This focus on security is commendable and necessary for gaining user trust, particularly in a sector that deals with personal and confidential information.\n\nFocused Functionality: The site is well-designed for its primary purpose\u2014appointment scheduling. This clear focus ensures a streamlined user experience and potentially reduces the complexity of the system, contributing to overall reliability and ease of use.\n\nAreas for Improvement\nOpportunity for Online Counseling: While the site currently focuses solely on appointment scheduling, there is a significant opportunity to expand into online counseling. This could not only increase the site's utility for users but also open up new revenue streams. Exploring this option could make the platform more versatile and competitive.\n\nFinancial Metrics Missing: A notable omission in the project is the lack of data on the cost to acquire customers and therapists. These metrics are crucial for assessing the financial viability and scalability of the platform. Including these figures would provide a clearer picture of the project's potential for sustainable growth and profitability.",

However, the inherent complexities and limitations of these models necessitate careful management of data quality, computational resources, model interpretability, and adaptability to ensure they deliver reliable and actionable insights for retail investors. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the sustained success and credibility.\n\nOverall, the architecture is well-structured for leveraging advanced technologies to empower retail investors, but careful consideration of scalability, latency, and security will be necessary to maintain optimal performance and user trust.",

I'm glad to see that the application make use of reliable tool like Google ML Kit\u2019s OCR for scanning skincare product labels as it is a smart application of machine learning for mobile. \n\nAlso, real-time detection of trigger ingredients shows technical maturity and a focus on user safety. Offline/local database usage is a good decision for fast, private ingredient matching. Symptom tracking via a structured questionnaire is a comprehensive feature which allows for consistent monitoring over time, helping users (and potentially doctors) spot patterns, nice! \n\nAnother key factor for tackling such issue is diet, I'm happy to see that be one of the considerations, the food ingredient checker broadens the app\u2019s utility, addressing a lesser-known but significant aspect of eczema management. \n\nThe app design appears well thought out from a chronic-condition management perspective\u2014daily usability, fast access to essential functions, and proactive alerting. Though, I'd hope to see if it could have much simpler interface or much straightforward app navigation for old people that is not really familiar with smart phones, also consider adding multi-language support, as eczema is a global issue.\n\nMore considerations for future improvement:\n- How well does OCR handle different packaging formats, fonts, or languages?\n- Health-related apps must address privacy clearly. How is user data stored, and is it compliant with health data protection standards\n\nOverall, EczCare demonstrates a solid mix of machine learning, healthcare awareness, and user empowerment. It\u2019s especially impressive for its holistic view by addressing products, symptoms, and diet, which are all key factors in eczema management. Good work!\n",

    "comments": "USM GradView 360 is a web-based management system designed to support postgraduate students at Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) in monitoring and managing their academic journey. The platform aims to streamline communication and administrative processes between students and academic supervisors. Core features include progress tracking, course information access, and the integration of a FAQ chatbot to provide quick answers to commonly asked questions related to postgraduate requirements, progress updates, and program-specific queries.\n\nThe project identifies a relevant institutional challenge\u2014improving the student-supervisor workflow and reducing administrative overhead\u2014and addresses it with a targeted digital solution. The inclusion of a chatbot adds an interactive layer that could reduce redundant inquiries and improve efficiency.\n\nHowever, the current solution appears to be a basic digital portal rather than a deeply innovative system. While practical and potentially useful, many institutions already offer similar platforms with self-service elements. The FAQ chatbot, though helpful, is not uniquely implemented or enhanced by advanced AI or learning capabilities. There\u2019s limited evidence of deep personalization, predictive features, or integration with broader university systems such as SIS or academic performance tracking.\n\nTo elevate the project, future work could explore predictive analytics (e.g., risk of delayed graduation), integration with thesis submission workflows, or smarter advisor-student communication tools.\n\nIn conclusion, USM GradView 360 addresses a clear need and is a good academic exercise in system development, but lacks distinctive innovation or technical complexity that would differentiate it as a standout project.",

    "comments": "This project proposes a web-based irrigation monitoring and automation system that allows farmers to track soil moisture and weather conditions, and to automate water pump control using an ESP32 microcontroller. Moisture data is collected through soil sensors, transmitted to a database, and visualized through a dashboard to help farmers make timely and informed decisions. A threshold-based automation logic is implemented to activate irrigation when moisture drops below optimal levels.\n\nWhile the concept addresses a real-world agricultural need, the technical solution is basic and follows a well-documented IoT pattern. Similar implementations using ESP32, soil sensors, and simple control logic are widely available in open-source communities and educational platforms. There is no indication of innovation in the control logic, predictive modeling, or dashboard analytics.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of supporting materials\u2014specifically, no demonstration video, no working prototype showcase, and no presentation slides\u2014significantly limits the ability to assess the actual functionality, integration quality, and user experience. In final year projects, these deliverables are critical to validate claims and demonstrate completion and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, the project meets the minimum expectations of a working academic prototype on paper but lacks both innovation and sufficient documentation to demonstrate successful execution.",

The statement addresses the parent concerns and opens the door to other possible ways to generate revenue in this segment.\nDevelopment:\n1.\tThe lack of high architecture design makes it difficult to assess the MVP fully, meaning the number of modules and the overall workflow to determine the product's viability from MVP to full production.\n2.\tThe demo has made significant strides, with the MVP incorporating most of the necessary modules, including communication, content filter, alert, and notification. While there were some areas that need further clarification, such as GPS Tracking and geo-fencing, the overall progress is commendable.\n3.\tIt was not clear if the app could prevent the child from accessing the administration part of the mobile device; this is a key component to prevent tech-aware kids from removing the application or changing settings.\n4.\tI recommend adding a web entry point for management instead of pure app deployment.\n5.\tEncryption, data security, MFA, and others were missing from the pitch, but they may already be in place.\nPitching\n1.\tGood pace, easy-to-follow and concise content. \n2.\tThe demo needed to be shorter in some sections and longer in others, e.g. the reporting.\n3.\tThe right amount of content; that said, keep in mind that the optimum fonts are 20.\n4.\tThe workflow was very good and easy to follow.\n\nEntrepreneurship:\nThe parental control apps market is projected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2022 to $4.6 billion by 2023. Households use various devices (Windows, macOS, Android, Linux), so apps need to support multiple OS types. Despite many apps available, those offering antivirus, VPN, and anti-malware tools stand out, providing multiple features under one subscription.\n",

The app offers real-time feedback on pronunciation errors using speech processing and natural language processing (NLP), delivering child-friendly corrections in a fun and engaging way. Structured into modules \u2014 Letters, Words, Sentences, and Stories \u2014 the platform supports progressive learning. Additionally, a Parent Dashboard allows caregivers to monitor their child\u2019s progress, reinforcing measurable outcomes and involvement.\n\nThe project addresses an important educational need, especially in regions where early access to high-quality English instruction is limited. The use of AI for real-time speech evaluation tailored for young learners is both practical and impactful. The interface design and modular learning flow are well-suited to the target age group.\n\nHowever, while the solution is thoughtfully executed, it is not particularly innovative from a technical standpoint. Pronunciation training apps for children already exist, and the use of AI speech tools (such as Google or iOS speech APIs) for this purpose is fairly common. There is no mention of custom speech models, localized pronunciation adaptation, or gamified learning that would give this app a unique edge in the edtech space.\n\nThat said, the app is a strong example of applied AI in education, offering a complete, usable product with real-world value \u2014 even if the idea itself is not new.",

If that person is having an account, then admin could raise a summons through the system and track on the pay back.\n- Maybe can include a university directory with details on the faculty, it might be helpful for the first time visitor.\n\nOverall, Excellence Job!",

The pricing model for renting sports gear is not compelling \u2014 from a user\u2019s perspective, purchasing the equipment may feel more worthwhile, especially when considering risks like late returns. The UI/UX design is disappointing and does not align with modern design standards; it appears outdated, resembling interfaces from a decade ago.\n\nThe gamification feature also lacks depth. Simply ranking users based on the number of bookings does not offer meaningful motivation or engagement, and it\u2019s unclear how this approach would genuinely encourage users to play sports more actively.\n\nOverall, the project lacks maturity and fails to meet expectations in terms of design, user value, and innovative execution. Significant improvements would be needed before it could be considered for promotion or broader deployment.",

    "comments": "This project explores the integration of an Automated Imaging System for Duckweed with an existing Water Quality Monitoring Platform, aimed at supporting plant biology research, particularly around duckweed growth and its environmental applications. Duckweed\u2019s unique biological traits\u2014rapid biomass accumulation, simple morphology, and clonal propagation\u2014make it a prime candidate for research in phytoremediation, carbon capture, and sustainable nutrition. However, current research is hindered by labor-intensive monitoring methods that lack spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nBy leveraging Raspberry Pi as a low-cost, portable computing device for image capture and integration, the project aims to automate plant monitoring processes while aligning environmental parameters (e.g., water quality) with visual growth data. This integrated system could provide researchers with a more scalable, time-efficient, and standardized way to observe duckweed growth under varying conditions.\n\nThe project stands out for its practicality and interdisciplinary approach, combining IoT, imaging, and plant science. While the core technologies (Raspberry Pi, basic imaging, and water sensors) are not novel individually, the contextual integration for a niche biological research area offers commendable relevance and utility.\n\nHowever, the project could benefit from:\n\nMore advanced imaging techniques (e.g., time-lapse, image-based growth quantification, or machine learning for leaf segmentation).\n\nDeeper software development (e.g., web dashboard, alert system, or real-time growth analytics).\n\nIn summary, this project addresses a specific research pain point with a practical, scalable solution. It is technically sound, clearly defined, and of high relevance to environmental biology.",

To begin, the SAA-QR system's functionality is simply configurable utilising current tools like as Microsoft Forms and other commonly available technologies. These technologies already provide event organisation, QR code production, and attendance monitoring, eliminating the requirement for a custom-built system.\nSecond, building a distinct system for such activities may result in needless complexity and resource allocation. Educational institutions may opt to use current platforms that staff and students are already acquainted with, so eliminating the learning curve and additional training necessary for a new system.\nTo summarise, while the SAA-QR system intends to enhance event management and attendance monitoring, actual implementation issues include redundancy with current technologies, resource allocation, consistent usage, scalability, and data security. These factors make the idea less viable in the actual world, especially as simpler, more established options are already available.",

The app integrates a Decision Tree machine learning model to provide personalized IF plan recommendations based on user attributes such as age, weight, height, and activity level. Developed using Android Studio and Firebase, with the ML model trained in Google Colab and deployed for offline use, the project reflects solid technical understanding and practical application of current tools.\n\nWhile the execution is commendable and the app serves a clear purpose, the solution lacks strong innovation. The core features\u2014fasting timers, BMI tracking, user profiles\u2014are standard in many health and wellness apps. The use of machine learning, though a positive inclusion, is basic and static, offering limited adaptability or learning over time. Without unique features such as behavioral adaptation, gamification, community interaction, or integration with wearables, the app does not stand out in a crowded digital health landscape.\n\nOverall, the project demonstrates good development skills and a working end-to-end solution, but from an originality and innovation standpoint, it feels more like a well-executed academic exercise than a groundbreaking product. Future improvements could focus on deeper personalization, user engagement strategies, and smarter AI integration.\n\nIn conclusion, Fast-Fit is a functional, beginner-friendly health app with commercial potential, but it would benefit from a clearer differentiation strategy to enhance its innovative value.",

Commercial solutions with comparable features\u2014including autonomous delivery, security protocols, and real-time obstacle avoidance\u2014exist from providers like Savioke, TUG, and Pudu Robotics. The project primarily consolidates known methods without introducing novel capabilities, new use cases, or differentiated technical solutions.\n\nWhile DEMO is a functional academic prototype suitable for learning, it does not offer a standout innovation in concept or execution.",

It is unsuitable to check Wi-Fi coverage, as a Wi-Fi analyser is required to create a heatmap of the signal strength across the coverage area. That said, you can conduct identity correlations, which compare the throughput and latency results from iperf3 with the signal strength data from the heat map.\n\nDevelopment:\n1.\tCombining Flutter, Kotlin, Dart, and iPerf3 for Wi-Fi performance testing is indeed an innovative approach. It leverages the strengths of these technologies to create a comprehensive, cross-platform solution for network performance assessment. \n2.\tSimilar developments in mobile devices and iPerf3 have also deployed iPerf2, as the latter has features that are not supported on iPerf3 and are necessary for multicast tests, bidirectional tests, and multithreading.\n3.\tsecuring the connection between the iPerf3 client and servers is one key challenge. This was not part of the presentation. This key, as the iPerf3, could be used for malicious work.\n4.\tThe length of the log capture was also missing. Can the engineer select how much data is collected?\nPitching\n1.\tGood content: the competitive landscape should be added.\n2.\tA more detailed development plan where AI/ML should be the last puzzle piece. Add other strategic features like iPerf2or Netspot for heatmap coverage to the least of the features to add.\nEntrepreneurship:\nIn 2021, the global market for application testing services was valued at approximately $40 billion. It is projected to reach around $60 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% from 2021 to 2026. This growth is driven by factors such as businesses' increasing digital transformation, the adoption of agile and DevOps methodologies, and the need for automated testing services to reduce operational costs and enhance quality assurance. \n",

This system is just about combining all feature into a single app. \n\n2 opinion based on my personal perspectives to be improve regarding innovative of AI chatbot and the real up sales proposal:\u2028\u2028 - Most of the car issue comes in weird sound happen in the first place. By determine based on the record sounds, specific with car model, utilise AI searching feature to target problem statement. \n - Once the problem statement has been determined, we can automate the booking to the nearest service centre whether it\u2019s from the user current location of the home address registered under the user profile. This brings the immediate up sales as user are right in trouble unlike the reminder which might get ignore by the user.\n\nOne of the best selling that impress me was the reminder not only notify for the services but also each of the components that required for maintenance from time to time.",

It is effectively speed up the pet adoption process in the condition of well data/info maintenance. The integration of AI/ML models like ResNet50 for breed classification and SegFormer for pet segmentation are advanced and appropriate for the problem. In another hand, this solution highly depends on the image quality uploaded, model generalization for classification may have difficulty with mixed breeds or rare species. ",
